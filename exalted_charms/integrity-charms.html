<h2 id="toc1"><span>Integrity-Protecting Prana</span></h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 5m; <strong>Mins</strong>: Integrity 1, Essence 1;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Reflexive (Step 2)<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Mirror (Undying Stagnation Defense)<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: One day<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: None<br />
The Sun’s Chosen define their own reality. This Charm perfectly protects the character from any Shaping effect that directly alters her mind, body, spirit, possessions, or Traits. This includes instantaneous Shaping effects and any new alterations caused by long-term Shaping effects. But it does not include alterations due to non-attack based Shaping effects, such as target number manipulation and teleportating the character; the former not being a Trait and the latter not being a part of his mind, body, spirit, or Traits, just where he is physically in the world. Wyld energy cannot create a serpent inside the character’s stomach or turn her armor to lava, whether it’s manipulated by an enemy or its own random whims, because these effects inflict immediate damage and the character’s DV is not applicable. Nor can it mutate her into in a Wyld mutant. This Charm does not protect against the miscellaneous dangers of the Wyld. If a Wyld effect creates a hundred-headed snake monster with burning chalcedony eyes that then eats the character, this is not directly altering the character’s body through Shaping. Possessions must be worn or carried or have the character’s Essence flowing through them to protect it from the Shaping attack.<br />
As a special note, telepathy is considered a Shaping attack as it alters the mind of the person by projecting thoughts into their mind. Additionally, the target number on a dice roll isn’t protected by this Charm as it isn’t a trait, merely circumstance of fate, meaning that Sidereal astrology affecting target numbers can bypass it.</p>
<h2 id="toc2"><span>Destiny-Manifesting Method</span></h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: -; <strong>Mins</strong>: Integrity 1, Essence 2;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: None<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Integrity-Protecting Prana<br />
A Solar forges her own destiny, and none gainsay her will. This Charm inflicts a -(Essence) external penalty on any rolled Shaping effect used against the character or their possessions. Characters using Shaping effects that involve the character can remove this penalty with any stunt that reconciles the Shaping effect with the Lawgiver’s sense of her own destiny. In the Wyld or the Labyrinth, this Charm reduces the frequency of random unfortunate incidents by a factor of 10. Additionally, <em>Integrity-Protecting Prana</em> is upgraded to block all unwanted Shaping effects instead of merely Shaping attacks; this includes Sidereal astrology and other non-attack Shaping effects.</p>
<h2 id="toc3"><span>Righteous Lion Defense</span></h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: -; <strong>Mins</strong>: Integrity 2, Essence 1;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Mirror (Eternal Enmity Approach)<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: None<br />
To the Solar Exalted, “death” and “surrender” are almost the same thing. This Charm helps a character hold fast to her fundamental Intimacies in the face of temptation. The player picks one of the character’s Intimacies when purchasing this Charm. For the purposes of this Solar Charm, this loyalty must be to an ideal, not to a person or a love, but sometimes to a relationship; not to a tribe or city, but sometimes to the nation she might build of them; not to a battle or a war, but to the extinction of one foe or the conquest of a great region. (Other Exalted have versions of this Charm that support different commitments.)<br />
This Charm allows the character to treat mental influence to betray or forsake that Intimacy as an unacceptable order (see p. 180). If the character voluntarily abandons that Intimacy or it becomes obsolete, this Charm ceases to function until, first, a new story begins and, second, the character chooses a new Intimacy to which the Charm applies. A suitable stunt may allow a new intimacy to bypass these rules at the Storyteller’s discretion. Players can also shift this Charm to a new Intimacy at any time by spending one experience point.<br />
Players can purchase this Charm a second time to reinforce one additional Intimacy. Any further loyalties require more specialized magic.</p>

From every Solar’s heart flows an infinite stream of arete: excellence, Virtue, and raw commitment to life. The player picks one Virtue when purchasing this Charm and can purchase this Charm multiple times to cover additional Virtues. Whenever the Solar would otherwise recover one or more Willpower points from stunts or natural recovery, this Charm gives the character the option to recover one point (one channel) of the chosen Virtue instead. The Storyteller may veto Virtue recovery from stunts opposed to that Virtue, such as the restoration of a Compassion point garnered from ripping an enemy’s heart out of his chest.</p>

In foul nests of demons whose ways of corruption assault the human mind; amidst the courts of faeries gluttonous for human souls; in Nexus, surrounded by a thousand temptations, though the whole world seeks to drag him down, the Lawgiver is unmoved. This Charm increases the character’s Dodge MDV by his Temperance for the remainder of the scene.

Like a dream slipping from a waking man’s grasp, the Solar eludes others’ attempts to chain his mind. The Solar uses this Charm in response to an attempt at mental influence, be it natural or unnatural. In addition to its core effects, this Charm perfectly negates that attempt at influence.<br />
This Charm defends the character against mental influence by forging an instant, sorcerously charged Intimacy (see boxed text) to an idea or ideal that protects him. For the purposes of this Charm, this Intimacy might be enmity with the person attempting influence, contempt for that person, or loyalty to something that the influence would make him betray. This effect is optional if the character already has such an Intimacy. If he has a preexisting one that is applicable, the magic can bolster it to inviolability instead. Characters observing the Solar when this Charm is used can make a reflexive (Perception + Investigation) roll against a difficulty of the character’s Temperance to notice the newborn or newly renewed enmity, loyalty or disdain. The Solar genuinely accepts the Intimacy to which he commits himself with this Charm, although the player decides how much weight he gives it compared to his other ideas, plans, loyalties and goals. At the end of the story, the Essence charge dissipates from the Intimacy, and it is no longer a perfect defense, though the character may maintain it for later use, the sake of the memory, or out of genuine feeling.</p>

The Lawgivers shatter delusions and see all things truly. This Charm shatters all Compulsion, Illusion, Servitude and similar effects upon the Solar. The character can ignore mental influence that would prevent her from using this Charm. Characters can substitute an unsoakable aggravated health level of damage for the mote portion of this Charm’s cost if they are otherwise unable to pay. This Charm is retro-cause active and thus no order can prevent the Solar from learning it if they desire, mentally compelled not to learn it or compelled not to desire learning it. Only time, experience points, and desire are the gatekeepers that prevent a Solar from learning this Charm. It stands to reason that a Solar that has been mind controlled will eventually learn this Charm.<br />
This Charm does not and cannot break the Great Curse, nor prevent it.</p>

Others look to the Lawgivers for strength against temptation. This Charm allows characters loyal to the Solar to replace their own Essence with the Solar’s Integrity score when calculating mental defense. It subtracts two dice (as a -2 internal penalty) from the dice pools of characters loyal to the Solar when they are actively attempting to betray that loyalty.

The Solar Exalted draw on their unwavering desire and intention to survive sustained mental assault. This Charm allows the Exalt to refuse unnatural mind control effects (see p. 180) and Virtue compulsions (see p. 115) at a reduced Willpower cost. This Charm reduces the Willpower cost by one point for each five motes spent. If the Exalt pays the entire cost in Essence, she does not accumulate Limit. <em>For example, if rejecting a supernaturally persuasive offer would normally require two Willpower, the Exalt can spend two Willpower; five motes, one Willpower; or 10 motes.</em> If the character would normally break free of the mental influence after spending a certain amount of Willpower, treat the character as having paid the full Willpower price even if it is paid in motes.</p>

The Solar dedicates himself to a new goal or ideal. If the Solar has not already established an Intimacy to this ideal, this Charm allows him to do so instantly. This Charm lets the Solar treat this Intimacy as an additional Motivation, with all the benefits and drawbacks thereof. Lawgivers can invoke this Charm repeatedly but they can benefit from only a number of additional Motivations equal to their Conviction. The Solar may substitute another Virtue in the place of Conviction for the number of additional Motivations if all the enhanced Intimacies give appropriate theme to them. <em>For example, having several enhanced Intimacies to end slavery and bring justice to several slavers would be suitable for Compassion.</em></p>

Reality itself bows to the prowess of the Solar Exalted when they act in accordance with the power infusing their Exaltation. All of the Solar’s stunts are upgraded by one category (to a maximum of being three-point stunts) when the Lawgiver’s actions reinforce her role as a god-king. Specifically, the Solar’s actions might involve: ruling over or protecting those less powerful than herself; administering territory or resources she owns; educating others; spreading either the worship of the Unconquered Sun or herself; or combating creatures of darkness. Successful stunts that are upgraded from two to three points by this Charm are not eligible to draw a point of experience as a reward. Natural three point stunts or those upgraded by Motivation, rather than being upgraded, add automatic successes rather than dice. If a stunt has already been upgraded due to resonance with the Solar’s Motivation, <em>Lion’s Roar Recovery</em> upgrades it again.</p>

Those who would tempt the noble Lawgivers from their righteous path pay a price in fire. This Charm is a counterattack that may be used in response to any unnatural mental influence directed at the Solar. The Solar’s caste mark blazes white and red for a moment; then, wherever the attacker may be, she is engulfed in a bonfire of pure white flames. This is treated as an automatically successful Shaping counterattack which inflicts (Essence x 2) dice of lethal damage (aggravated against creatures of darkness). Should any astrology be used to attempt to divine the target’s fate during the scene in which <em>Sacrosanct Soul Retribution</em> is directed at him, such inquiries automatically succeed, but return only the following puzzling message: THE ANATHEMA IS HERE. She may choose another message if she desires.<br />
This Charm may be used regardless of the range from which unnatural mental influence is deployed, but may only be used once in response to a particular static source of mental influence. <em>For example, the Solar could only deploy this Charm in response to a book enhanced with Linguistics Charms once, no matter how many times he read the book.</em><br />
At Essence 6+, the Solar may also pay one point of Willpower to declare the target of this Charm as a creature of darkness, though this does not work on other Solars or Yozis. Additionally, at this level, anyone slain by <em>Sacrosanct Soul Retribution</em>’s white fire is twisted and castigated into a new form, reborn as a terrible monster possessing the same nonmagical traits they previously enjoyed, with (Solar’s Essence x 3) points of mutations added. If the beast was not a creature of darkness before, it is now. This beast is cleansed of most of its previous memories, all Intimacies, and any Essence-based powers it may have possessed. It is reborn with a new, unalterable Motivation: To loyally serve the Lawgiver who created it. Thus do those who would dare tamper with the minds of the Sun’s champions pay for their temerity.</p>

In eternal night, the Solar Exalted are evidence of a perfect light that once was and shall be again. Should the sun go down forever, the Lawgivers stand as proof of an imperishable hope, surpassing the light from whence they sprang. By learning this Charm, the Solar substantiates for himself the foundational principles of Holy by which the universe abides and the Unconquered Sun decides. In the event of the death of the Unconquered Sun, the Solar’s Holy Charms retain their full capacity against all creatures of darkness. This Charm also permanently lowers the cost to activate all Charms with the Holy Keyword by one mote, to a minimum of zero motes.</p>

The virtue of the Lawgivers is like the sun at noon. Clouds might obscure it, but its light can never truly be banished or denied. Whenever the character suffers under a source of unnatural mental influence that alters his behavior, the effects of the unnatural mental influence become Obvious to all observers, making it clear that the Solar labors under some manner of curse or trickery rather than his own desires. Immaculate doctrine already accounts for this with tales of Anathema as wicked spirits possessing the unlucky.<br />
The Charm also makes it Obvious that the Solar is not himself (though it does not make the source of his odd behavior Obvious) when in Limit Break, but only to those who harbor a positive Intimacy toward the character. The Neverborn tremble in their tombs when their curse is laid bare before the world thus. This Charm’s effect upon observers cannot be resisted, as it is not a form of mental influence. It is simply the truth.</p>

Internalizing her dedication to the principles of her own legend, the Lawgiver shines with the very radiance of her patron, bringing the light of the sun to Creation in fact as well as metaphor.

This light shines brightly enough to affect beings to how far the light can be used to read by, typically out to a radius of (Essence) yards at the 8-10 mote level of display, and out to a radius of 100 yards at the 11+ mote level of display.</p>

Although the power of even the youngest of Lawgivers is sufficient to rock the pillars of Heaven and slay the makers of the world, some Chosen find themselves unsatisfied with any limitations upon their power. Reaching beyond, they grasp for greater might at any cost.<br />
As a permanent upgrade to his competence, the Solar gains the ability to spend experience normally to buy his Essence rating up to a dot higher than his age would otherwise allow (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 275). This is treated as his real, natural rating for the purpose of buying Attribute and Ability dots, Charms, and other such traits. Yet, he may enjoy the benefits of this higher Essence rating only while <em>Glory to the Most High</em> is active. When the Charm is not active, he is treated as though his Essence rating is whatever it would be if he did not possess <em>Glory to the Most High</em>, and as though he did not possess any Charms or dots that this lower Essence rating would not permit him to obtain.<br />
The Solar’s anima immediately flares to its full iconic splendor when <em>Glory to the Most</em> High is activated, and recedes at its normal rate. The character also gains 10 motes of Essence (three in the Personal Essence pool, seven in the Peripheral Essence pool) filling out the sudden difference in his Essence pool’s capacity. When this Charm ends, the character must roll the higher of (Essence) or his primary Virtue, and add a number of points of Limit equal to his successes.<br />
When the Solar's age becomes old enough to naturally have their Essence at this increased level, it permanently increases instantly. He may still spend experience to raise it again while under the effects of this Charm. This Charm converts to experience when the character becomes old enough to naturally buy Essence 10.</p>

When a Lawgiver’s vast strength at last reaches its limit and he falls in defense of Creation, the world itself may cry out for its savior to rise up and fight on.<br />
This Charm automatically takes effect when the character’s final Incapacitated health box is marked off with lethal or aggravated damage, provided the Solar fell while attempting to defend or champion those weaker than himself, at the Storyteller’s discretion.<br />
(As a general guideline, any situation where the Solar could reasonably have channeled his Compassion likely qualifies.) Subtle ribbons of golden Essence wind across the battlefield, trailing back to the masses on whose behalf the Lawgiver fought. If they believe in him, then he hears their prayers as his life bleeds away; if they spurn him despite his efforts, their deep need for a savior calls out to him regardless. One long tick after becoming Incapacitated, the Solar rises from the ground in a flare of sizzling Essence, iconic anima burning around him. Half of his health levels immediately restore themselves, along with half his total Essence and Willpower (assuming he fell with those pools reduced below the halfway point). This Charm may not be triggered more than once per season.</p>

Embracing the judgment of the Unconquered Sun and searing that wisdom into her heart, the Solar becomes an avatar of her caste. The effects of this Charm vary depending on the character’s caste.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dawn</strong>: When employing her anima power, the Exalt gains four bonus dice to all combat actions instead of just +2 to his DV's; should his anima be lit it glows white hot like a new star. Additionally, the Dawn Caste's bonus dice for intimidation work against creatures immune to fear, for such beings feel not terror, but feel the sheer awe of what the Dawn Caste can do while being bathed in his light and gives them a moment to reconsider their choices.</li>
<li><strong>Zenith</strong>: When employing her anima power, the Exalt doubles the normal soak benefit against creatures of darkness , and the raw damage of attacks directed at creatures of darkness is instead (Essence x 2). Passively she may reflexively burn every inanimate corpse within 30 yards at will.</li>
<li><strong>Twilight</strong>: When employing her anima power, the Exalt reduces the cost of all sorcery by half or (Essence x 2), whichever cost is less, to a minimum of one mote. This reduction does not apply to necromancy.</li>
<li><strong>Night</strong>: The difficulty of rolls to track or notice the character rises by (Essence) rather than (Essence/2) and passively suffers no difficulty increase to Stealth actions due his anima flaring until such actions become impossible.</li>
<li><strong>Eclipse</strong>: The Exalt takes the laws of Heaven into her own hands. Whenever someone breaks an oath she has sanctified, the Eclipse is immediately aware of both the transgression and transgressor. Indeed, if she so desires, the Solar may even specify the circumstances in which the oath-breaker’s botches will manifest (though subject to Storyteller approval). The Exalt may actually forgive the oath-breaker of any punishment, and Heaven will not vent its wrath in the usual manner if they decide so, but no unnatural mental influence may compel them to do such. As a final, as-yet-unrealized benefit, the Eclipse anima power as enhanced by this Charm may find purchase upon the very Yozis themselves. When deferred with the Fiend anima power, the Ebon Dragon suffers punishment in the oathbreaker’s stead thanks to an obscure and overlooked clause in his surrender oath.</li>

Solars avoid being dazzled by the world around them by contemplating their own magnificence, or that of their divine patron, who is without equal and whose blessing they carry.

For a Solar, defeat is only a marker in the chapters of existence, rather than the end of the book. The Solar may gain motes when confronting an opponent who has defeated the Solar in his present incarnation or any of his past lives. Defeat in this context means physical combat; defeating the Solar in social combat does not qualify, nor does beating him at Gateway or other contests. This Charm does not grant the Exalt special knowledge of defeats that occurred in past lives—the Solar must come by this information by any valid means of doing so.<br />
The Lawgiver gains (Essence + 2) motes upon activation, and one additional mote each time his DV refreshes for the rest of the scene. The Solar may only activate this Charm once per scene, and only in battle against one who has defeated him. If the fight concludes with the Exalt’s victory, he has avenged himself, and can no longer activate this Charm against his vanquished opponent until beaten by them again. Otherwise, the Solar may continue to assume <em>Righteous Avenger’s Aspect</em> until he has avenged himself.<br />
An inconclusive battle is not sufficient to release a character from the Solar’s vengeance. If an earthquake splits the street between the Solar and his enemy, razing the city and carrying the two halves so far apart continued battle becomes impossible, the Solar does not lose his ability to activate this Charm against that opponent. Nor does fleeing the Solar release the target from his vengeance.<br />
At Essence 3+, the Solar may activate this Charm on behalf of a person or group of people he has a positive Intimacy toward. In this case, the Solar needs only evidence of physical harm to activate this Charm. Seeing a man strike his wife would be sufficient to channel the Lawgiver’s wrath into overdrive, as would watching his personally-trained horsemen scathed by a hail of arrows from a deathknight’s bow.<br />
This Charm requires that the Solar is aware he faces an opponent who has defeated him or wronged the subject of one of his positive Intimacies. The Solar must believe the target has actually have done so—the Charm will function if the Lawgiver is mistaken, but not if he is unaware of what his opponent has done. The Solar may always activate this Charm on behalf of his Lunar mate, even at Essence 2.</p>

In the First Age, the Solars experimented not only with transhumanist biology, but also transhumanist philosophy, seeking to emulate their patron. This is not the only form of extreme Virtue Solars of the First Age explored, only one transhumanist paradigm. Solars can purchase this Charm once per dot of Integrity (to a maximum of four times), with each purchase enhancing one Virtue rated 5+. The choice can’t be altered, but the Charm’s effects recede if the Solar lacks a sufficient Virtue rating for whatever reason. The Solar regains one channel for each Virtue augmented by this Charm once per day at sunset. Additionally, whenever an Solar would roll dice for a Virtue enhanced by a purchase of this Charm (whether as a pool by itself or bonus dice from a channel), the Charm converts these dice into automatic successes. This isn’t optional, so characters must always spend Willpower to resist the urges of extreme Virtue. See below for how Virtues express themselves differently through this Charm.<br />
<strong>Compassion</strong>: The Solar cares for each and every person in Creation, even if she never knew them, and will die trying to protect them. The specifics of the Solar's greater good must be worked out with the Storyteller and must make sense for the character’s Intimacies and other Virtue ratings. In this ethos, she will do anything to save a lives as necessary wage a war to save even a single life, even if it kills millions in the process; but at the same time she won't kill even her worst enemy. She can channel Compassion on any action that serves her sense of justice and impossible compassion. However, she must spend Willpower to take actions to kill anyone.<br />
<strong>Conviction</strong>: Inhuman extremes of Conviction do not wildly deviate from the ethics of mortal paragons except by degree. Therefore, the applicability of Conviction channels does not increase. However, whenever mental influence seeks to alter the emotional context of any of her Intimacies, lessen them outright or alter her beliefs or memory with an Illusion effect, the Exalt may spend one Willpower and one Conviction channel to perfectly dodge that influence. Doing so breaks any ongoing effects from the dodged influence, and this may be done later to throw off influence as an alternative to dodging the initial social attack or other source. In addition to the normal behavioral prohibitions on high Conviction, a Solar with this Charm can’t knowingly act against any of her Intimacies unless she has spent Willpower to act against her beliefs for a scene.<br />
<strong>Temperance</strong>: With extreme self-control comes absolute clarity of purpose. Whenever mental influence would build an Intimacy or exert an Emotion effect over her, the Solar may dodge by spending one Willpower and one Temperance channel. This defense follows the same overall rules as the dodge afforded by Epic Zeal of Conviction apart from the types of influence it defends against. The range of actions that extreme Temperance can enhance does not improve. Unfortunately, her ascetic devotion also requires her to spend Willpower to act dishonestly or show bias in any situation, not just matters of importance. She must also spend Willpower to break promises, even those lacking that formality and solemnity of a sworn oath.<br />
<strong>Valor</strong>: The Solar knows no peers or superiors and, therefore, ceases to understand fear as a meaningful concept. If she would somehow fail a Valor check despite 5+ automatic successes, she still succeeds with threshold of one. She treats all mental influence that would instill fear or alter her behavior through playing on fears as unacceptable orders, also terminating any fear-based Intimacies upon purchase of this Charm. The Storyteller decides when this defense applies. Epic Zeal of Valor does not broaden the range of actions that Valor channels can aid, nor does it broaden the scope of prohibited actions. Interestingly, the Dawn, Dusk, and Slayer Caste anima banner still affect the character, as the Primordial found out during the war, as this doesn't provide immunity to fear, they merely cease to understand it.</p>

Like their patron, the Lawgivers are capable of conjuring up the will to do the impossible when pushed to their limits. By spending a moment to remind themselves of their limits, the Solar pushes themselves beyond it. Every five motes spent on this Charm grants the Solar one point of temporary Willpower. Alternatively, the Solar may spend a Virtue channel to gain one point of Willpower instead. There is no limit to how much they can gain beyond their normal temporary Willpower maximum, but each point gained in this fashion causes the Solar to gain point of Limit. Combined with <em>Phoenix Renewal Tactic</em>, the Solar may recover Virtue channels instead.</p>
