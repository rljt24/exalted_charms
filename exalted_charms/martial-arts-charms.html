<strong>Type</strong>: Reflexive<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Enhanced<br />

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: None<br />
The Solar infuses her hands with the strength of her Essence and strikes like the Unconquered Sun. This Charm enhances an unarmed Martial Arts attack, improving its Accuracy by one and its Damage by two and making its damage lethal. The Solar can parry lethal hand-to-hand attacks without a stunt until his next action.<br />
<strong>Enhancement</strong>: This Charm adds the magical material benefits of orichalcum to the Solar’s natural attacks while Solar Hero Form is active.</p>

<strong>Keywords</strong>: Enhanced, Martial-ready, Obvious<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Instant<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Fist of Iron Technique<br />
This Charm is also called the “Pillar-Breaking Blow.” The Lawgiver’s anima flares, and he strikes like the judgment of Heaven. This Charm supplements an unarmed Martial Arts attack against an inanimate object, doubling the raw damage of the attack.<br />
<strong>Enhancement</strong>: When used by a Solar, this Charm costs one mote and also ignores the object’s soak.<br />
<em>Martial-ready</em>: Melee.</p>

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Fist of Iron Technique<br />
The clinch of the Lawgivers does not fail. The Solar’s grip is inexorable, and she may, if she chooses, squeeze the life from the strongest opponent. This Charm makes clinch crush damage lethal. This Charm also adds the Solar’s Essence in dice to the dice pools to inflict, maintain, and control a clinch. It also adds the character’s Essence to the damage of clinch crush attacks.<br />
<strong>Enhancement</strong>: The dice added by this Charm do not count toward the Solar’s dice caps.</p>

The Solar suffuses his body with the Essence of the Sun. He becomes a paragon of strength and skill, radiant with the power of a legendary hero returned. There is nothing formal to this fighting style, but there is an unstoppable and unchallengeable grace to it. This is an honest battle art, for champions, gladiators and heroes. It was forged in the dawning of the world so that the Lawgivers could face the greatest monsters with nothing save their hands and skill and be undaunted by them.<br />
This Charm allows the Exalt to count the successes of unarmed Martial Arts attacks twice before subtracting successes from external penalties. This Charm also allows the character to make an unarmed Martial Arts block against ranged and lethal attacks without a stunt.<br />
<strong>Enhancement</strong>: While this Charm is active, the Solar adds half his Martial Arts rating to his natural bashing and lethal soak. Solars cannot combine <em>Unsurpassed Solar Martial Arts</em> with this Charm's effects as they are the same thing; instead knowing that Charm reduces the cost of this Charm by two motes.</p>

The fury of the Lawgivers scatters their enemies like leaves before the storm. This Charm supplements an unarmed Martial Arts attack. It ensures that the Solar’s attack throws his enemy backward one yard for each point of raw damage. Targets that strike hard objects take one die of damage for each yard they would otherwise have traveled. This damage is typically bashing but it can be lethal if the target strikes a sufficiently dangerous object.<br />
<strong>Enhancement</strong>: The target is thrown three yards for each point of raw damage. At Essence 4+ the Solar may add one mote to Heaven Thunder Hammer’s activation Cost in order to send the victim flashing an additional (Essence x 5) yards toward an object he can perceive. This movement occurs before the normal movement caused by Heaven Thunder Hammer begins. This additional knockback distance does not add to the damage the victim takes for yards they would have otherwise traveled, but helps to ensure that the victim strikes a solid object at the absolute beginning of his flight, even if that object is far from the point of attack. This effect expressly allows a Lawgiver to bash a rooted target into scenery within (Essence x 5) yards without actually moving the target. The target does not appear to move; rather nearby walls and trees develop giant craters as if the victim were being driven into them, while the Solar’s blows are seen to unleash devastating shockwaves that annihilate the scenery. Treat all such blows as incurring the full damage of a Heaven Thunder Hammer collision at point-blank range. Using this effect turns Heaven Thunder Hammer Obvious. Finally, the Cost drops to two motes.</p>

The effective application of strength casts aside small nuisances. The Solar can use this Charm when he ends a clinch by throwing his opponent. This Charm increases the distance he can throw his opponent to (Martial Arts x 5) yards upward or (Martial Arts x 10) horizontal yards. Characters thrown over cliffs or high into the air take falling damage normally. Targets that strike hard objects take damage as with <em>Heaven Thunder Hammer</em>.<br />
<strong>Enhancement</strong>: The Solar hurls opponents (Martial Arts x 7) yards upward or (Martial Arts x 14) yards horizontally, and the cost drops to two motes.</p>

The Essence-driven fists of the Solar Exalted can stun even legends, giants, armored cataphractoi and monsters. The Lawgiver spends up to twice his Strength in motes and makes an unarmed Martial Arts attack. If he hits, this Charm replaces his normal damage with stunning damage. He inflicts one die of stunning damage for every mote spent on this Charm. Extra successes add to his damage as usual. Stunning damage ignores natural and armor soak, but it can be soaked with Charms. Each success on the damage roll imposes a -1 internal penalty to the target’s dice pools and DV for the next three actions. This is a Crippling effect (see p. 152). Stunning damage counts as stunning penalties in conjunction with Wicked Dissolve Dust.<br />
<strong>Enhancement</strong>: Solars may spend as much Essence as they like when activating this Charm.</p>

The Lawgivers’ arts of battle bring an unrelenting punishment to their enemies. This Charm is a magical flurry of many unarmed Martial Arts-based attacks. The Exalt makes a total number of attacks equal to (her Essence + 3). This Charm lets the Solar make these attacks regardless of the weapon’s Rate and does not count against it, doesn't have multiple action penalties accumulated between attacks, Speed and DV penalty equal to the highest of any individual attack, and only counting as one action for multiple action penalties, suffering the highest multiple action penalty performed from any one action.<br />
<strong>Enhancement</strong>: The Solar can use these attacks to instead perform a Martial Arts related actions, such as readying a Martial Arts weapon, or a Simple Charm from Solar Hero Style, such as the Form Charm or <em>Ox-Stunning Blow</em>.</p>

The Solar burns with Essence. Her strength and agility rise to inhuman levels. This Charm supplements a single attack. It makes the target’s Parry DV inapplicable. If the Solar hits, this Charm allows her to make one further unarmed Martial Arts attack by hurling the first opponent into another. This attack has a range of (Martial Arts x 5) yards. It is also unblockable. The first opponent is treated as a weapon with -3 Accuracy and +4B damage. If the attack misses or the Solar targets empty space, the first opponent travels the full (Martial Arts x 5) yards, with effects as noted in <em>Heaven Thunder Hammer</em>. Hurling one opponent into another operates with the same timing as a counterattack. This Charm cannot enhance a counterattack, and it prevents the target from responding with Charms with the Counterattack keyword such as Solar Counterattack or Leaping Dodge Method. The second attack is resolved in Step 9 of the original attack and imposes a cumulative counterattack-based penalty of -1 on the Solar’s DV.<br />
<strong>Enhancement</strong>: The Solar’s opponent, when used as a weapon, has +2 accuracy and +6B damage. The attack made with this opponent may be applied to all characters within that unfortunate’s flight path.</p>

A child must learn to crawl before it can walk, just as the wicked must learn to fly before they can stand against the Solar Hero. The character’s fist becomes a falling star, striking the earth to unleash a shockwave that rips through the ground in a straight line up to (Essence x 50) yards distant. Upon reaching an opponent in range, the attack terminates in a massive detonation of force, with a diameter of 10 yards and reaching up to 100 yards high. Everything caught in the range of this attack is immediately hit by an unblockable <em>Heaven Thunder Hammer</em> strike using a dice pool of (Dexterity + Martial Arts + Essence). Characters struck by this attack are always launched up or away from the Lawgiver. The Solar is immune to the effects of his own attack and may stand in the absolute center of this devastation unharmed.</p>

Essence coalesces around the character’s hands, suffusing them with great and lasting power. For the rest of the scene, the character adds a number of levels (not dice) of damage equal to twice his permanent Essence to all Martial Arts attacks. When this Charm is active, the character speciﬁes whether their attacks inﬂict bashing or lethal damage without penalty (aggravated may be downgrade but not upgraded to). He can even choose to inﬂict bashing damage when wielding a weapon that would normally inﬂict lethal damage (for example, smashing an enemy across the temple with the hilt of a khatar).</p>

The Solar meditates for ﬁve minutes, sinking into a trancelike state of concentration to let her martial skill reach an instinctive level. Her player then rolls the character’s (Wits + Martial Arts), adding a number of successes equal to the character’s Essence. The Solar may spend a Willpower point on the roll, augment it with Charms or use any other appropriate normal method for improving the success of this roll, and the player carefully notes the number of successes she achieves. At some time later in the scene, the Solar may reﬂexively replace the results of any single Martial Arts roll with the successes the player rolled during the activation of this Charm. Doing so replaces the chosen roll in its entirety, and any bonuses that applied to the previous roll are lost. After this Charm has replaced a Martial Arts roll, the Charm expires, and the character must activate it again if she wants to reap its benefits again. A Solar may wait for her opponent to roll for his defense before replacing the successes of her attack roll. A Solar cannot have more than one activation of this Charm ongoing at any given time.</p>

A master warrior has complete knowledge of his surroundings as a ﬁght rages on. A Solar master of this technique instinctively uses everything around him to his advantage. Fighters with this Charm have a reputation for foolhardy bravery and dumb luck, for they make use of surprising and spectacular aspects of the ﬁght, from props to scenery to their opponents’ own weapons and attacks. Any time a Solar gains bonus dice from a stunt, his player may spend three motes per stunt die to convert each stunt die into an automatic success. (That is, if the Storyteller awards three stunt dice, the Solar’s player can spend nine motes to turn all three dice into automatic successes.) To use this Charm, the Solar must make use of his surroundings or some ongoing aspect of the ﬁght—such as by levering a soldier around into his comrades by the haft of his spear. He can also use this Charm when he performs a surprisingly brave or foolhardy act—such as leaping from the crow’s nest of a ship to rain a thunderous elbow drop down onto a Child of Siakal in the water.</p>

To achieve her true Solar greatness, a master warrior must challenge herself constantly against foes of at least equal greatness. Those who have mastered this Charm understand this principle, throwing themselves at more and more talented foes to feel the joy of battle. Anytime the Solar successfully defends herself from an attack that accumulated no fewer successes than either the Solar’s Essence or 5 (whichever is higher), she may activate this Charm to gain a temporary Willpower point. That is, the Solar’s Dodge or Parry DV (including any bonuses from weapons, shields or magical effects) must completely cancel out an attack roll of no fewer than the aforementioned number of successes. This Charm does not allow the Solar to gain more temporary Willpower than her permanent rating. Simply having the fortitude or the armor to absorb all the damage inﬂicted by an attack does not qualify as a successful defense for the purposes of activating this Charm.</p>

In war, in skirmish or in single combat, no single side of a conﬂict entirely determines its outcome. Ultimate victory depends not just on the victor’s skill and power, but on his ability to read his opponent, to react to him and to manipulate him into a position of weakness. This Charm enhances that ability in a Solar warrior. Anytime an enemy takes a physical action against the Solar in combat, the Solar may reﬂexively activate this Charm in response. The Solar’s player commits one mote per success that the character’s opponent’s player made on his attack roll. At any time during the scene, the Solar may remove those committed motes to inflict a -1 external penalty per two motes to any single attack or defense against him. A Solar must choose to add the penalty before the player makes his roll. A Solar may activate this Charm multiple times, but each use is &quot;instanced&quot; against a single target that has attacked him. He cannot spend committed motes gained from one target when attacking another, but can use those gained against multiple attacks from a single target. Additionally, he cannot have more the (Wits + Martial Arts) total committed motes from this Charm, regardless of the number attacks or targets against him.</p>

When the Solar martial artist activates this fantastic display of power she pushes herself beyond her limits temporarily; her anima ﬂares to full totemic glory and she is reshaped, her body marked by her totem and the colors associated with her caste, leaving no doubt who she is the Chosen of. To activate this Charm, the Solar must already be using <em>Solar Hero Form</em>, then activate this Charm, while still maintaining his commitment and activation of <em>Solar Hero Form</em>. In this temporary state of power, the Solar's player adds her character’s Essence in automatic successes to any combat actions she makes—including damage rolls. The number of added successes cannot exceed the number of dice the player rolls. This counts as the Solar's Virtue channel for the action.<br />
The Solar must roll the character’s highest Virtue on every action for which she uses this Charm. Each success increases her Limit by one. Should the Solar suffer Limit Break during the use of this Charm, she does not actually undergo the effects of the Limit Break (yet). The actual effects of the Limit Break, including the bonus to Willpower, begin after the scene ends. Once this Charm's power ends, the Solar's power is spent; for everyone 10 points of Limit he accumulated under the effects of this Charm, he loses one dot of Essence and his anima's max glow level is reduced one step (1 dot caps it at the 11+ level, 2 dots to the 8-11m level, etc etc etc). The Solar's anima is no longer powerful enough to grow to that level, regardless of the number of peripheral motes spent, and it longer gains the benefits and drawbacks of being at that level, meaning if the Solar cannot produce 11+ level, he no longer automatically activates his anima banner when he spends 11+ peripheral motes (he may still spend five motes to activate it however). The Solar's Essence rating is healed at a rate of one dot per month. If a Solar is reduced to an Essence of 0, instead his ability to channel Essence is lost and he is considered mortal, with all the accompanying downsides, until he &quot;heals&quot; back to Essence 1. Each lost dot of Essence counting as a single Crippling effect, and his anima max level recovers one level when his Essence heals one dot.<br />
The Solar may, at any time, reflexively end this Charm, wherein he continues to use <em>Solar Hero Form</em>.<br />
The Solar may also reflexively trigger this Charm for free when performing doing an action is in line with his Motivation, Virtues, Intimacies, or any other suitable act for a god king of Creation, as determined by the Storyteller, but doing so permanently lowers his Essence instead of it being a Crippling effect, and if reduced to Essence 0, he loses his Exaltation and reverts to being a mere mortal who may never Exalt again. This effect can be activated as a Martyr effect instead, granting (Essence x 2) automatic successes instead but the Solar dies once the scene comes to an end, his body, mind, and soul fading away into motes of glowing light, which without direct intervention of incredibly powerful soul magic to hold his soul together he will never reincarnate, and now with only enough time to give a somber farewell to his friend and allies. If the Solar perishes before that, they merely suffer normal death.</p>

The Chosen of the Most High need no esoteric lessons to rock the world back on its heels, their strength and prowess are weapons enough. The Solar’s unarmed attacks automatically stun opponents they strike and roll damage dice against (see Exalted, p. 153). This stunning effect is cumulative; if a Solar made a three-attack flurry and struck his opponent with all three attacks, his target would suffer a -6 internal penalty until the Solar’s next action. Failure to pierce Hardness and perfect soak negate the application.</p>

Exalted on the field of battle cannot be concerned with such trivia as leather and plate. If an attack supplemented by this Charm successfully strikes a target, any nonmagical armor the target is wearing is immediately destroyed. Heavy armor explodes off the victim’s body in a spray of rivets and plates, while lighter protection produces an eruption of torn leather and flying chain links. Against magical soak, this applies the two levels of the Piercing tag to the Solar's attack.<br />
Should the attack also actually inflict damage, the Solar may pay an extra 1m as a Shaping effect to immediately cancel all Charms, spells, astrological powers, and other supernatural powers with a duration greater than Instant but less than Permanent which provide the target with increased soak or Hardness, and against magic armor, this causes a forced deattunement to the armor. Essence-forged armor (such as <em>Glorious Solar Plate</em>) and Charms that provide armor soak (such as <em>Armor-Forming Technique</em>) is instantly dispelled.</p>

A Solar’s intercepting fist may even split a bolt of lightning. By paying five motes, the Solar may interrupt an attack made against him with one of his own. This Charm must be activated in Step 2. The character rolls a standard unarmed Martial Arts counterattack in Step 6, subtracting her successes from any remaining successes the attacker may have accumulated after comparing his attack to the Solar’s DV. The Solar then applies the rolled counterattack to her opponent in Step 9, doing damage as normal if it lands successfully. This counterattack may be used to respond to lethal and ranged attacks, but may not strike an opponent who is out of range, nor may it be used to respond to an unblockable or unexpected attack. An attack negated with this Charm is considered to have been stopped by the Solar’s Parry DV.</p>

Even in chains a Solar may bring an enemy to his knees. This Charm is identical to <em>Break the Storm</em>, but for the following exceptions: the character may only activate this Charm when he is in a clinch he does not control; this attack is unexpected, and may only be made against opponents who are attempting to attack the Lawgiver while he is being grappled. This Charm guarantees the primacy of this strike; even if all his limbs are bound, the Solar will get a limb momentarily free, or otherwise land a crushing headbutt. This attack does not allow him to escape the clinch; he remains under the control of the clinching opponent until he can win control of the grapple. This Charm has a special interaction with <em>Heaven Thunder Hammer</em>. If the target uses a perfect soak effect to block the damage from a combo in which <em>Chained Thunder Strike</em> and <em>Heaven Thunder Hammer</em> have been triggered simultaneously, the force of the Solar’s attack is redirected back through his body at the opponent who is holding him, applying its raw damage to the controlling clincher. If this unexpected attack does damage, both the Lawgiver and the foe clinching him are hurled backwards per the effects of <em>Heaven Thunder Hammer</em>. If they collide with a solid surface, only the Solar’s opponent takes any damage from the collision. <em>Chained Thunder Strike</em> is incompatible with <em>Lightning Strikes Twice</em>.</p>

The killer instinct of the Solar Hero is sufficient to break an opponent’s strategy. Whenever the Solar uses a Martial Arts attack to do at least three lethal or aggravated or six bashing health levels of damage to his opponent, he may pay five motes to remove that damage from the attack. This may reduce levels of damage inflicted on his opponent to 0. Instead of taking the full damage of the Solar’s attack, his victim’s Form is broken; that is, if his opponent had a Form-type Martial Arts Charm active, a successful application of <em>Stance Breaker Instinct</em> removes it from the target. Victims of this attack may still find themselves injured or killed by the attack. As a point of clarification, if the attack on the damage does more than three lethal or six bashing levels, the remaining health levels of damage still apply.<br />
Furthermore, the Exalt may not knock the same Martial Arts Form-type Charm off her target more than once in ten actions. Having knocked her opponent out of form, she may attack different Form-types her opponent assumes before ten actions have been completed, but doing so resets the ten-action count for all Form-type Charms she has knocked off her opponent in the current battle. <em>For example, the Lawgiver may punch her opponent hard enough to knock him out of Tiger Form; five actions later, she knocks him out of Snake Form; she may not remove either Tiger or Snake Form from her opponent for another ten actions. As a further point of clarity, two or more Solars attacking a single opponent with this Charm track these actions separately.</em></p>

Treat this attack as one being enhanced by <em>Sledgehammer Fist Punch</em>, doubling the pre-soak damage of the attack.</li>
<li>When the target takes health levels of damage from such an impact, the Exalt’s player may choose to defer a number of health levels from the victim and transfer them into the structure his victim has impacted with. Each health level deferred in this way translates to five automatic levels of damage done to the structure in question. If the attack would have been sufficient to kill the opponent, and accrued more than seven successes on the damage roll, the damage done to the structure is automatically sufficient to destroy it.</li>
<li>If the opponent takes any health levels of damage upon impact, he is dazed by the collision and takes a -5 internal penalty as a Crippling effect for one action. This effect applies even if the Lawgiver uses this Charm to reduce the health levels of damage his victim receives to 0.</li>
</ul>
<p>At Essence 4+ this Charm expressly allows the Solar to destroy magical objects or structures, but does not allow him to destroy imperishable objects or structures (such as daiklaves or the Imperial Manse). In addition, victims of this Charm may never be used to destroy magical objects or structures they do not own (see Exalted, p. 238). Therefore, hurling a peasant at his master’s manse will only make a mess, rather than destroy the manse.</p>

The loftiest works of men, gods, and Primordials alike are as dust before the fury of the Solar Exalted. This Charm supplements an unarmed Martial Arts attack directed against a nonmagical structure. The Solar ignores the structure’s soak, Hardness, and health levels, and automatically destroys a volume of the structure encompassing (Essence x 10) yards from the point of the attack’s impact, distributed as the player sees fit.<br />
At Martial Arts 5+, Essence 5+ this Charm may be activated for a cost of ten motes, one Willpower to encompass a volume of (Essence x 50) yards. This tends to cause palaces to collapse, city walls to crumble, and the sides of mountains to cave in. At Martial Arts 6+, Essence 6+ this Charm may also be applied to non-imperishable magical structures.</p>

As the Yozis well know, the Lawgivers have a way of turning certain death into a crushing victory. When in a clinch, the Solar may use this Charm in response to an attack being made against her from outside the grapple. Doing so forces the clinching opponent to suffer all incoming attacks for the rest of the action as though those attacks had been directed at him. This Charm may manifest in a number of ways: the Lawgiver is seen to twist out of the path of a daiklave at the last instant, causing it to shear through her captor; the Exalt exerts superior leverage to drag her opponent into a volley of arrows, using him as a shield. In any case, the Solar clearly demonstrates to her foes why they should not touch what they cannot hold.<br />
If used in response to an area-of-effect attack encompassing the Solar and the one grappling her, such as <em>Death of Obsidian Butterflies</em> or a supernatural ice storm, the Solar reduces the effect’s raw damage by half (round up) and adds this amount to the raw damage inflicted on the character clinching her.<br />
This Charm offers no benefits if the Solar is not in a clinch.</p>

Before the Solar Exalted, light could only chase shadow; due to the Lawgivers, it may capture it as well. This Charm may enhance a Martial Arts attack. The character lashes out at his target’s shadow, pinning it to the ground, a wall, a tree or other immobile scenery; this attack is unblockable and undodgeable without magic. When pinned in such a way, the victim is trapped within a yard of his shadow until he is able to pull it free, a feat requiring a miscellaneous (Strength + Athletics) roll at a difficulty of the Solar’s (Martial Arts rating x 2). The successes gained on multiple attempts to pull free are added together cumulatively, but the target may make only one such attempt per action. While rooted, the target may not be moved by knockback effects; if knocked back, such as by <em>Heaven Thunder Hammer</em>, the target is considered to strike a hard surface after traveling only one yard. Beings without shadows are immune to this, while powers to manipulate shadows or living shadows resist using the prescribed difficulty, and until they cannot be used. If the target's shadow is not visible this Charm cannot work.<br />

To be caught in the grip of an enraged Solar is a terrifying prospect, for their mighty hands may rend even the makers of the universe. The Solar may activate this Charm to enhance a crush action when she has control of a clinch. No matter how large the opponent, the Lawgiver’s strain pulls her foe into the air over her head, where she may shake it violently, causing its bones, organs, limbs—or souls—to smash together, colliding repeatedly as the Solar thrashes her victim like a ragdoll. The Solar re-applies steps 7-10 of attack resolution (Essence - 1) times, repeatedly damaging her victim.<br />
If the target is warstrider-sized or larger, double the raw damage from these attacks. If the target is a landscape-scale or larger (such as Mount Mostath), multiply the raw damage by five. Used against such enormous targets, the Charm becomes Obvious.</p>

Solars of the Dawn Caste are the greatest of all warriors, capable of feeling the truth of a foe’s conviction in the spirit of his attacks. A hand that lies has no strength over the Lawgiver, and only the truest salvos may strike the Solar Hero. A character activating this Charm modifies his opponent’s attacks. For one action, all attacks against the Exalt suffer an internal penalty equal to the difference between the Ability being used and the lowest of the attacker’s Archery, Martial Arts, Melee and Thrown ratings. <em>Daunting the False Savior</em> must be activated while the character is using a Form-type Charm and may expressly enhance any Form-type Charm the character knows.</p>

It is within the skill of the Solar Exalted to sear the souls of their lessers with a taste of true power. Those so enlightened are rarely ever the same again. This Charm supplements all Martial Arts attacks the Solar makes while it is active. On a successful strike, the character’s anima irradiates the target, suffusing her Essence pathways with a constricting flow of overwhelming Solar Essence. Every time the target is struck with this Charm, the activation cost of her next Charm rises by two motes to a maximum surcharge of the Solar’s Essence rating. In addition, the next Charm with a Flaw of Invulnerability that the target wishes to activate costs an additional one Willpower. If two or more Solars strike the same target with <em>Sun-Suffusing Slag</em>, the mote surcharge on her Charms may only be increased to the rating of the highest-Essence Solar to strike her; individual lower-Essence Solars may not exceed their own Essence maximums for the purpose of stacking this surcharge. Furthermore, the Willpower surcharge to Charms possessing a Flaw of Invulnerability incurred by this Charm is never stackable. Exalts other than Solar Exalted who are continually struck with <em>Sun-Suffusing Slag</em> begin to exhibit Solar anima bleeding through their own anima displays as they continue to expend Essence in order to expel the Solar’s irradiating influence.<br />

The Solar’s might is such as to knock a star from the sky or place one into orbit. This Charm permanently enhances its prerequisite, adding an additional (Essence x 5) yards to the distance a target can be launched on a successful hit, as well as allowing the character to use <em>Heaven Thunder Hammer</em> to launch a foe straight up. The rules for targets impacting with solid objects as a result of this Charm remain otherwise unchanged, though it is worth noting that what goes up must come down; it is entirely possible an opponent might be smashed into a high ceiling and then have to contend with falling damage.</p>

This Charm offers a permanent upgrade to <em>Heaven Thunder Hammer</em> and <em>Crashing Wave Throw</em>. On a successful knockback or throw using either of those Charms, while the target is still hurtling towards its doom but before they have collided with a solid object, the Solar may pay six motes and one Willpower, activating <em>Lightning Strikes Twice</em> to make a second attack against his opponent. Doing so cancels the collision effect of those Charms, but allows the Solar to make an undodgeable, unblockable attack against the target, taking advantage of its helpless flight. The Solar flashes instantly across the distance from the ground to his hurtling foe, appearing alongside his opponent to make this attack, automatically intercepting his target on the last instant before any collision with scenery or natural termination of the target’s flight could possibly occur. When using Archery or Thrown to make this attack, the Solar need not personally follow the target. Instead, his ranged attack flashes into position beside the target before completing the attack, ignoring the weapon’s Range value. <em>Lightning Strikes Twice</em> may not be triggered more than once on a single tick against a single target.<br />

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Lightning Strikes Twice, Pounding Hammer of Devastation<br />
This Charm upgrades its prerequisites, allowing the Solar to pay six motes, one Willpower to activate <em>Lightning Strikes Twice</em> against multiple opponents simultaneously. The Solar may make a single unexpected attack against (Dexterity + 3) targets, with the same rules and limitations as <em>Lightning Strikes Twice</em>. During this time he is seen to blur across the sky in every direction, flashing from target to target, striking blows against each while his anima flares and strobes like the violent concatenation of a lightning storm. Using <em>Storm Burst Explosion</em> counts as an activation of <em>Lightning Strikes Twice</em>, preventing the Solar from re-using that Charm unless he has <em>Split the Chase</em>. Should the character use <em>Heaven Thunder Hammer</em> and <em>Split the Chase</em> to reactivate <em>Lightning Strikes Twice</em> against multiple opponents through the use of this Charm, the arc of flashing recursions is seen to crawl ever outward from the center of impact, leaving blazing jags across the sky and flashing at each point of impact. This attack may be driven through a third iteration through the application of <em>Flicker-Fade Recursion</em>.<br />
As with <em>Lightning Strikes Twice</em>, the character may opt not to follow his opponents, choosing instead to make an ranged attack against each of them. This attack follows the same rules as those in <em>Lightning Strikes Twice</em>, except that the Exalt splits this attack amongst multiple opponents. When using <em>Storm Burst Explosion</em>, the character may select which valid targets to strike and may choose to ignore valid targets, allowing them to collide with scenery per the rules of <em>Heaven Thunder Hammer</em>.<br />

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Heaven Thunder Hammer<br />
This Charm enhances both <em>Crashing Wave Throw</em> and <em>Heaven Thunder Hammer</em>. The character may pay three additional motes when activating either of those Charms. Calculate the damage on impact as normal. However, as the tremendous force of the Solar’s attack vibrates through the world at the point of impact, a shockwave flings the opponent back towards the Solar, allowing the Exalt to apply a finishing move which deals (Essence) post soak levels of damage, to a maximum of five health levels of damage. The finishing move is not a second attack roll but rather a second visual consequence of the first attack. If the character takes no health levels of damage from a collision with scenery caused by <em>Crashing Wave Throw</em> or <em>Heaven Thunder Hammer</em>, he is unaffected by the shockwave and <em>Second Impact Flourish</em> automatically fails to activate<br />
For this Charm, distance is important: the Solar must be in range in order to add this damage to his enemy. To determine range, use the yards the victim would have flown on impact to determine how far he is flung back toward the Exalt. If the Solar is in range, the victim is seen to be catapulted back into the Lawgiver’s finishing move. Finishing moves may take a form defined by the player. Example finishing moves include a flying uppercut that blows the opponent’s falling body out of the air, or leaping backwards to catch the target in a flying backflip suplex that leaves a crater in the street.</p>

The Solar’s might is like a black hole, having gravity sufficient to crush worlds with his fist. This Charm permanently enhances its prerequisite. On a successful strike with <em>Heaven Thunder Hammer</em>, the character may choose to spend up to his Strength rating in motes for the purpose of subtracting yards from the distance his target would have flown, to a minimum of zero yards. This creates a well of force which sucks the victim in, preventing him from being launched away as the Solar visibly strains against his own might, gathering a terrible force which spills out into the surrounding landscape, shattering scenery and fracturing air at the motonic level. This moment of devastating collision cannot last. A blast tears through his victim as the Solar completes his attack. The target is ripped away with the force of a hurricane and hurled across the landscape. Add (Essence) to the number of yards which remain from the effects of <em>Heaven Thunder Hammer</em> for calculating the total distance the target will fly after breaking the Solar’s inertia. These extra yards are treated exactly as those accumulated by this Charm’s prerequisite. The target suffers any impact with scenery as per the rules of <em>Heaven Thunder Hammer</em>. Multiply the number of yards reduced by three and convert them into levels of damage to the damage from scenery, even if there is none.</p>

To provoke the ire of a Lawgiver is to bring down the thunder. Upon paying the activation cost of this Charm, the Solar may make up to (Dexterity x 2) attacks against a single opponent or (Dexterity ÷ 2, round up) attacks against all opponents within (Dexterity) yards, contingent on the following factors: the Solar must make each attack with a different improvised weapon; the Solar reflexively seizes and swings a different object with each attack; each improvised weapon may not be reused during the tick these attacks occur on; the Solar may only use objects within (Dexterity) yards; and only objects the Storyteller deems the Solar can lift and swing may be employed. Upon a successful hit, every character struck with this Charm must roll (Dexterity + Athletics) at difficulty 2 or suffer knockdown. In addition, suitably large objects (such as banquet hall tables, wooden beams, or temple pillars, subject to the Storyteller’s discretion) may be used to strike all opponents within (Dexterity) yards, even when the character has chosen only one target for this Charm; if he has chosen multiple targets, this attack does not reduce the number of attacks he may make against each target singly. Lastly, if the Storyteller deems there are no objects for the Solar to wield, this Charm may not be used, and if the Solar runs out of appropriate props to attack with, the Charm ends prematurely. All objects wielded with this Charm are considered to have Accuracy of +1 in spite of their improvised status. The first unwitting victim of this Charm was a Lunar stalker who offended a Solar in an emporium of musical instruments.</p>

Moving with incomparable speed, the Solar may snap out multiple strikes in a single motion, defying all notions of having any peer. Though <em>Solar Combination</em> is an Extra Action Charm, the Solar makes only a single Martial Arts attack roll. On a successful strike, the Solar is seen to strike his foe (Essence) times. For each of these blows, the target suffers a -1 internal penalty until the Solar’s next action. This attack ignores armor soak and soak from Stamina, but not natural soak from magic. While Solar counts as having only made one attack and the target only takes damage from a single attack, any Charms used in conjunction with <em>Solar Combination</em> which cause stunning (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 153) have their effects applied as if they were struck (Esssence) times. The character pays the activation cost of such Charms only once to benefit from <em>Solar Combination</em>’s modifier, as if they were applying it to a single attack, rather than an Extra Action effect.<br />
At Essence 5+ Solar Combination may be used as a Supplemental Charm.</p>

In a moment of pristine stillness, the Solar’s inner eye opens. Caught between calm and storm, she becomes the channel through which all forces flow, and that which would tear her asunder is cast aside. When the character is struck by a close-range attack, she may activate this Charm to make an unarmed Martial Arts counterattack against her opponent—specifically, a clinch attempt. If successful, the Lawgiver melds the course of her opponent’s attack into a throw to the ground or a solid surface within up to (Martial Arts x 5) yards, inflicting the presoak damage of the attack which triggered this Charm upon the unlucky opponent.<br />
Alternately, the Lawgiver may choose to hurl her victim at another foe within range of the throw. This is modeled as a second (Dexterity + Martial Arts) attack with a base damage equal to the raw damage of the attack which triggered <em>One With the Wave</em>.<br />
As normal, this attack occurs at Step 9 and doesn’t negate the attack itself, though it does work with perfect soaks as normal and does not inhibit the damage of the counterattack.<br />
At Essence 4+, the Solar may use <em>One With the Wave</em> to respond to successful ranged attacks using physical projectiles. In this case she appears to be scathed by the missile, curling along the angle of the shot to pluck it from the air and whip it back at her opponent. This (Dexterity + Martial Arts) counterattack has a range of the Solar’s line of sight and a base damage equal to the attack’s raw damage against her. At Essence 5+, the Solar may use <em>One With the Wave</em> to answer energy-based attacks, channeling them directly through her body and back at her enemies.</p>

In addition to this benefit, by paying an additional five motes upon activating <em>Crashing Wave Throw</em>, the character may further enhance the effect of the Charm. The Solar violently swings his victim through the air until they blaze like the aura of a re-entry. Charged by the Solar’s wrathful judgment, the victim is turned into a missile upon release, and may be aimed at further targets of the Lawgiver’s animosity. In addition to the normal effects of <em>Crashing Wave Throw</em>, where the victim lands, the blazing Essence of the Solar’s wrath detonates like a bomb: the victim and all other unfortunates within (Solar’s Essence x 2) yards are subjected to a one-time environmental damage effect with Damage 10L, Trauma 3. This damage is multiplied by five against objects and structures. The Solar’s killing intent fuels this Charm’s explosive effect, and so it may not be used to turn willing allies with perfect soak effects into impromptu artillery, nor may it be used on objects or inanimate corpses.</p>

A Lawgiver who suffers the works of the wicked is not patient, only busy. <em>Cast Down Stars Condemnation</em> makes a Solar’s feelings known—in the form of absolute destruction unleashed. This Charm permanently enhances its prerequisite; upon activating it, the Solar may pay an additional ten motes, one Willpower for the following benefits: First, double the raw damage the target suffers from colliding with an object. Next, increase the base environmental damage produced by the victim’s impact detonation to 20L. Finally, upon impact the victim plows through scenery like a falling star, shattering the landscape and creating a massive explosion while his body digs a gigantic trench in the earth or bowls through towers, devastating a skyline. In addition to the enhanced base damage of <em>Cancel the Apocalypse</em>, all non-artifact scenery within (Solar’s Essence x 100) yards of the victim’s point of impact takes an arbitrary amount of damage sufficient to destroy it. The Storyteller may describe this destruction as multiple explosions that level a city, massive shockwaves that flatten a forest, terrifying implosions that leave a mountainside a smoking crater, and so forth.</p>

For the most part, the Solar Hero is a picture of gentility. However, the ill-timed flailing of an assassin or a Yozi with poor table manners may catch a Lawgiver in the worst of moods. The Solar may activate this Charm to make an unarmed Martial Arts counterattack in response to a successful close-range attack. On a successful counterattack, rather than inflicting damage, the Solar automatically throws his opponent 100 yards for every die of pre-soak damage on the attack that triggered <em>Sky Breaker Throw</em>, inflicting appropriate falling damage on impact. If the attack exceeds 20 pre-soak dice, <em>Sky Breaker Throw</em> hurls the opponent ten miles. If the Solar uses <em>Sky Breaker Throw</em> to respond to an attack inflicting 30+ pre-soak damage, the Solar may fling his opponent from his position half the distance across Creation.<br />
Against an attack of 50+ raw damage, the range of the throw becomes infinite, allowing the character to designate a fitting location for his foe to touch down. <em>For example, the Solar may choose to bounce his victim off the tip of the Imperial Mountain, in which case the target is catapulted to one of the far ends of Creation. Alternately, the character may express his displeasure by hurling his victim into the heart of the sun. If the Solar is particularly wroth however, he may fling his foe out into the stars, where his victim smashes through an unseen layer of Creation and comes screaming down over the brass skyline of Malfeas to leave a crater in the street.</em> Any impact triggered by a throw of 20 or more pre-soak dice carries a penalty of arbitrarily high damage, sufficient to kill on impact. Due to a peculiarity in the distance between Creation and the Demon City, if the Lawgiver’s victim survives being slammed into Malfeas, he will be unable to move from his crater of impact for five days, until time has caught up with him. Being targeted with a social or physical attack causes time to catch up with the character, allowing him to rise and act as normal. The player and Storyteller may work together to come up with additional interesting results for a throw of this magnitude. Note that <em>Sky Breaker Throw</em> requires that the victim be hurled into a specific location; the player may not choose to throw his victim into a limitless vacuum of empty space or send them infinitely sailing across the Wyld.<br />
When used in realms other than Creation, <em>Sky Breaker Throw</em> may not be used to throw opponents into Creation save through stable passage points (such as a shadowland during the day, or an open portal between Creation and Autochthonia; under no circumstances may a Yozi be hurled out of Malfeas). Players should work with their Storyteller to define new and interesting parameters for a victim’s landing inside of their current realm. Possibilities include, while fighting in the Underworld, banking the First and Forsaken Lion off the well of Stygia and into the maw of Oblivion; or while in Malfeas, throwing Ligier down Isidoros’s throat.<br />
This Charm’s magic will not function without the Solar channeling his retributive fury into it; as such, it may never be used for the purpose of intentionally facilitating rapid transportation, rather than acting as a weapon.</p>

The Exalt hefts her up one-armed into the air and slams her with a thunderous punch from his other hand.<br />
The opponent flies up to (Martial Arts x 4) miles away over the course of approximately five minutes and plummets back to earth, impacting the land at terminal velocity to suffer the usual damage and inflict the same damage to the impacted surface (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, pp. 126-127). Everyone within (the Infernal’s Strength x 10) yards of the impact point (including the Infernal) must check for knockdown at a difficulty of (the Infernal’s Strength).

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Solar Hero Form<br />
The character’s fists blaze with the revelatory truth of the Unconquered Sun. This Charm may be activated whenever the Solar successfully strikes a being with an unarmed attack. Tongues of cleansing golden flames erupt from the target’s eyes and mouth and she screams in pain as every instance of unnatural mental influence affecting her abruptly terminates regardless of source or potency. Only the fealty of akuma, the bindings of demons, the Great Curse, and similarly inviolable effects chosen by the Storyteller ignore this Charm.</p>
