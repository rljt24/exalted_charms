When it does so, the shadow is replaced by the actual weapon, which disappears from the Sidereal’s hand at last and appears stuck in the target.\nThe Sidereal ignores all external penalties on attack rolls with this Charm, including range. The Charm ends as soon as the weapon or its shadow successfully hit the target. On a miss the shadow returns the Sidereal so it may be thrown again.\nSidereals with Essence 3+ can lend their weapon the official authority to send out messengers of its fate, allowing the actual missile to rest lazily in the Exalt’s hand.

The weapon continues to do so until the target removes the projectile. Removing it is a miscellaneous action that requires a (Strength + Athletics) roll against a difficulty of (Seer’s Thrown). The light from the weapon extends yellow tendrils that snatch and pull in airborne objects. Such objects might be insects, loose debris, birds, or other foes’ projectiles.\nOnce per tick, by spending two motes, with any errant missile within (Exalt’s Essence x 10) yards of the victim, when anyone misses his target with a Thrown or Archery attack, the Sidereal may reflexively redirect the attack. Doing so summons the errant projectile toward the embedded one. As a result, the person whose character missed with the attack reflexively rerolls the failed attack. Any Charms that supplemented or otherwise modified the original attack still apply to the rerolled one; the character does not need to pay to activate them. A botched attack against any target, from a character in range of the victim affected by this Charm, can be redirected to the Charm’s victim regardless of the form of attack and rerolled, including swords or martial arts attacks as fate causes the attack to land by happenstance."},

The conjured weapon has the following traits: Accuracy +1, Damage +4L, Rate 2, Range (Exalt’s Essence x 10), Tags: P. The attack cannot be parried, only dodged. Upon injuring the target the weapon disappears.\nWhen an Exalt enhances Essence Thorn Practice with Willful Weapon Method, she creates a shadow of a shadow, both of which are loathe to abandon their traveling companion. This allows both the original Essence Thorn Practice weapon and the shadow created with Willful Weapon Method to continue to exist and attack until the shadow strikes and replaced with the real weapon.

This attack can only be dodged, not parried: if the target tries to parry, the strip sticks to the parrying limb or weapon. If the strip hits the target, the strip sticks to him for the  of the effect, wreathing him in a sickly yellow glow.\nWith the prayer strip stuck to him, the target feels an insane Compulsion (an unnatural mental influence) to hurt the Sidereal who put the strip there. Resisting this urge s one Willpower point per action. The Compulsion remains for as long as the target can see or hear the Sidereal. Hitting with the prayer strip inflicts no damage. It cannot be removed short of destroying it. The Compulsion prevents the victim from removing or allowing the removal of the prayer strip. The Compulsion is ignored for the rest of the scene after doing so five times.\nWhenever the Sidereal takes damage during the effect’s , a hatchet made of yellow Essence appears floating waiting to be thrown next to his hand, and gaining a stored reflexive attack.\nWhen he wishes to throw the hatchet he need not ready the hatchet or even drop his current one to wield it, and makes a normal Thrown attack with it at only the prayer strip marked target. The thrown attack is undodgeable and unblockable, with a lethal base damage equal to the Sidereal’s Essence and an Accuracy of 0. Each health level of damage the target takes from weapon heals the Sidereal for the same amount. The attack doesn’t suffer range penalties and has a max range of a quarter mile. He must still have knowledge of the target’s location to hit it.\nThe Sidereal can only have (Essence + 3) stored reflexive attacks and hatchets. Charms that accrue reflexive attacks don’t generate hatchets but can be used to throw a hatchet if one is available. The reflexive attack generated from this Charm need not be used to throw the hatchets, they can be used for normal reflexive attacks, and a normal action can also be used to throw the hatchet instead.\nThe effect lasts until the target dies, the Sidereal ceases to commit the Essence or the prayer strip is destroyed. The Sidereal can have only one such prayer strip active at a time.\nThe Sidereal may fling Essence hatchets in response to damaging attacks from characters other than the bearer of the prayer strip. Attacks without real harmful intent behind them or attacks against which the character chooses not to apply his DV do not allow the Sidereal to reflexively attack and heal. The hatchet cannot be used to defend with, is expended on use, and may only be thrown at the prayer strip marked target.\nSidereals may maintain as many uses of this Charm as they wish, to the limits of their motes, Willpower and health."},

The Seer defers his name and any claim he has to a life beyond his ultimate purpose, setting them aside as collateral so that the prayer strip can invigorate him and drag him along toward his doom. His identity forgotten by the world, whether he wears a resplendent destiny or not all who meet him are subject to Arcane Fate regarding memories of him, even those who are outside fate or otherwise immune to Arcane Fate normally, such as other Sidereals. This can be avoided temporarily by stealing a name with Name-Pilfering Practice (see page 73), but only so long as he acts the part of the stolen name.\nWhen an Exalt activates this Charm, he must choose a goal, which then nests in his heart in place of his name. This grants him a sorcerous Intimacy of unceasing dedication to the goal, which cannot be removed by any means. Influence opposing the goal is an unacceptable order. He suffers a -2 internal penalty on actions unrelated to the goal, and a -5 internal penalty on actions contrary to the goal. None of the Exalt’s own Charms or other powers can overcome these penalties; he cannot ignore them.\nAs recompense, the character gains an extra success on all actions that further the completion of the goal. He ignores any wound or fatigue penalties on actions that are not contrary to the goal, even to the point of continuing to act when he should be unconscious. When performing a stunt that would resonate with the Intimacy if it were a Motivation, the Sidereal converts the stunt’s bonus dice into automatic successes, and may as his stunt reward choose to heal one lethal health level of damage or three bashing levels.\nWhen the Exalt’s goal is completed, his name is returned to him as One Direction Invocation ends.

Each redirected effect counts as a scene eroding any Intimacies of loyalty or friendship that the companion may have for the Exalt. Once all such Intimacies are gone, the companion will tend to resent the Sidereal and may leave or even attack him, but until then they suffer their impressed guardianship without complaint."},

They supplant the circumstance and desire of all of Creation with their plans. An Exalt using this Charm affixes a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Drowning Maiden in his shadow, wrestling the world into the desired shape and pinning it there with a knotted sutra. As he does so, he decrees to the world what it must do, a circumstance or occurrence that must take place within the current scene, and it will happen in the most plausible way possible.\nThis is a far-reaching Charm, and potentially very strange. It narratively creates new resources for the Sidereal, but these are things that have always existed in the world. Wealth arrives by way of a lost Guild caravan. During a pitched battle in the wilderness, “reinforcements” arrive in the form of a native horde that hates one side more than the other. Evidence of a crime is covered up by a sudden house fire. This Charm creates and sets scenes, and even introduces new characters. This means that it is often Shaping, but it may instead act as a Compulsion on the animals and people nearby who could fulfill the needs of the Sidereal’s vision.\nGenerally, phenomena and obstacles conjured by this Charm should have values for Damage, Trauma, difficulties, external penalties, or most other values that are no higher than (Exalt’s Essence). Obstacles might have soak values double that. When the Sidereal’s desired destiny requires characters, the closest, relevant and most likely to be susceptible candidates have their MDV compared to the Exalt’s (Manipulation + Presence). If their MDV is lower, the candidates are subject to an unnatural Compulsion to fulfill the destiny, unless they spend 4wp to ignore it. Characters with higher MDVs, or who reject the influence before they fulfill the destiny, cause this Charm to search for the next best candidates, but no more than once during each of the Sidereal’s actions."},

The Seer touches the object, while doing so, she knots the object’s destiny to the fate of a chosen person or location. The character must know this person or place by name, and have something physically connected to the target: a swatch of a person’s clothing, a few hairs, a bit of soil or a creature from a target location or the like.\nThe destiny-guided object moves toward its goal for as long as the Sidereal keeps Essence committed to the Charm. This may take less than a day for a person in the same town, or many months to cross Creation. Initially and each week thereafter, the Sidereal’s player rolls (Wits + Craft [Fate]) to see how quickly or how far the object moves toward its destination; the Storyteller sets the difficulty for this extended roll.\nThe object sent by this Charm may simply be useful in its own right—or dangerous, such as a forged map designed to lure the target into a trap. The object can also carry a Sidereal astrology effect as part of the object’s fate-crafting, as a way to deliver ascending or descending destinies to people or places the Sidereal cannot reach directly.\nThe Sidereal may set any object on its way with this Charm, not only those she creates, needing only the name of the place or person. She cannot target attuned artifacts, and this can be dealt with as a Shaping effect when targeting other objects.\nThe Storyteller sets a cumulative difficulty based on both distance and probability, which may range as high as 50. It tends to be harder for things to get from Chanta to Luthe, but if the Exalt starts the object’s journey by dropping it into the back of a Guild caravan it should require fewer successes than leaving it on the side of the road. The cumulative difficulty for an object journeying within the same realm of existence should rarely exceed 20, and for traveling between realms of existence it should rarely be less than 30. Do not multiply the necessary successes based on cross-realm travel.\nThe difficulty for each roll is the same as the per-roll difficulty to Craft the object, as it is more likely for treasures and wonders to be caught up in new destinies. The Charm ends prematurely only if the Exalt rolls more than (Essence) botches in a row.\nAt Craft and Essence 5+ a Sidereal may use this Charm to banish things from a realm of existence, instead of simply sending it somewhere else. Doing so is a normal invocation of the Charm, with a cumulative difficulty appropriate to sending the object to a destination in another realm of existence. Once it passes beyond the bounds of the originating realm, however, it becomes lost to that world.\nThe destiny tangled about it will not permit it to return. As long as the motes remain committed to this Charm, the object travels freely outside the realm from which it was banned. Any attempt to return it there meets widespread cosmic resistance. For every dot of Essence the Sidereal possesses, either a botch will occur on an action necessary to return the item, similar to a broken Eclipse oath, or some new circumstances will arise to prevent or redirect its return. Once these preventive threads of destiny have been worn away, the Charm ends and the item may return freely.\nThe instant before he dies, a Vizier may empower his banishments to persist past his ending. At that time, he chooses which banishments he currently maintains that will continue and which to release normally. Thereafter, the effect cannot be undone without ablating the protective destinies that keep the object away, often requiring access to the Loom of Fate or powerful magics."},

These gifts seldom possess significant monetary value… but occasionally turn out to be just what the character needs later.\nReturning to the tree before five days pass offends the spirits before they finish leaving gifts. For each day the Sidereal refuses to wait, remove one success from the player’s roll.\nThe clues and trinkets do not necessarily imply any special knowledge on the part of the wood spirits leaving them.

The moving region does not interact with physical Creation while the Sidereal moves, but he cannot drag a moving region onto an inhabited area.

He infuses the strips with Essence and names a target for each strip. (These targets must both be within 10 miles of the Sidereal.) The prayer strips disappear in flashes of blue flame (an Obvious event, but nothing about the Charm is Obvious to the targets). Activating this Charm is a five-minute ceremony wherein the Sidereal consecrates the relationship he is fabricating. He must have spent at least a scene interacting with both targets at some point in the current story, and he must have gauged their hearts by reading their motivations successfully (Exalted, p. 131). Each one then reappears wrapped around a bone in the named targets’ bodies. The targets can’t feel or see the embedded prayer strip unless the flesh over the strip is somehow removed. For as long as the Charm remains in effect, those particular bones become as difficult to damage as the prayer strips themselves (per the rules on destroying a prayer strip, on p. 125).\nWhen the Sidereal’s player activates the Charm, he attempts one (Manipulation + Socialize) roll against each target’s Dodge Mental Defense Value, and adds his Essence in automatic successes each time. If he succeeds, he can then craft a new relationship (social and emotional) between the two targets. This relationship lasts for as long as the strips remain within the targets’ bodies, even if the targets have never met each other before: fate inexorably pushes the two characters together into their new relationship. While the Sidereal’s Essence remains committed, the targets experience a magically enforced major Intimacy toward each other, and a target must spend a Willpower point to act significantly at odds with the relationship for a scene. If a character spends a number of Willpower points equal to the Sidereal’s Essence on subsequent occasions to allow himself to act at odds with the relationship, the effect ends for that character. (Half of the committed Essence is no longer committed.) The other targeted character remains under the effect, however.\nSurgery can dislodge a prayer strip, but doing so requires 12 successes on an extended (Dexterity + Medicine) action.

Without the Illusion effect to reinforce the Intimacy, the two characters can lose the Intimacy by normal means, or keep it if they (and their players) so desire.\nThe targets may act against the imposed Intimacy without spending Willpower, but they suffer appropriate penalties (see the Emotion keyword)."},

But it does not include alterations due to non-attack based Shaping effects, such as target number manipulation and teleportating the character; the former not being a Trait and the latter not being a part of his mind, body, spirit, or Traits, just where he is physically in the world. Wyld energy cannot create a serpent inside the character’s stomach or turn her armor to lava, whether it’s manipulated by an enemy or its own random whims, because these effects inflict immediate damage and the character’s DV is not applicable. Nor can it mutate her into in a Wyld mutant. This Charm does not protect against the miscellaneous dangers of the Wyld. If a Wyld effect creates a hundred-headed snake monster with burning chalcedony eyes that then eats the character, this is not directly altering the character’s body through Shaping. Possessions must be worn or carried or have the character’s Essence flowing through them to protect it from the Shaping attack.\nAs a special note, telepathy is considered a Shaping attack as it alters the mind of the person by projecting thoughts into their mind. Additionally, the target number on a dice roll isn’t protected by this Charm as it isn’t a trait, merely circumstance of fate, meaning that Sidereal astrology affecting target numbers can bypass it."},

But the skill of the Lawgivers is such as to smother bonfires with a single arrow. This Charm has two uses. The one mote version enhances an Archery attack, preventing any peripheral motes spent on the attack from adding to the character’s anima banner. In addition, if the attack does health levels of damage to the target, that target’s anima display rises by a number of motes commensurate to the peripheral motes spent on the attack. Because the Solar is shooting out her own anima, this Charm expressly allows her to tag non-Exalted opponents with anima displays. All targets struck with Flashing Sunspot Attack suffer the same Stealth deficiencies as characters flaring their anima banners (see Exalted, p. 114).\nThe second use of this Charm folds into the first use: the character may spend one mote to activate this Charm. However, instead of attacking a particular opponent, she may fire her anima into the scenery in an attempt to uncover hidden opponents. As above, any additional peripheral motes she spends on this activation are voided. Upon making this shot, her current anima display automatically drops down a level. Where her arrow lands, it creates a heatless bonfire of the Solar’s anima 50 yards in diameter, ending all concealment magic in the area and making stealth in the vicinity of the flare impossible. A Solar in the 8-10 range of anima display may choose instead to pay two motes to make this shot, dropping her down two full levels and creating a bonfire 100 yards in diameter. By paying a third mote, the Solar can void an 11-15 mote display, creating a bonfire 200 yards in diameter. Characters who use this Charm to drop their anima into the 1-3 range are considered to have spent only a single mote of peripheral Essence for the purposes of rebuilding their anima banner.\nAt Essence 4+, the Solar may use the one mote version of this Charm to move bonfires she has created by shooting through them. The blaze is snuffed out by the arrow’s passage, and reappears wherever the arrow lands. At Essence 5+, this Charm reveals the presence of dematerialized spirits and demons within the area of the bonfire. In addition, the Lawgiver may shoot out the anima of other characters, using the same mote costs to downgrade their anima as she would to void her own display. In this instance, the Lawgiver’s shot need not hit the character in question; merely passing close by is enough to puff out someone’s Essence candle. Her arrow snuffs her target’s anima display and deposits it wherever the shot lands, creating a bonfire as if she were shooting out her own anima.\nCharacters wishing to defend against having their anima snuffed may cut the arrow from its course with a successful parry, or may move their anima from its course through a successful dodge, assuming they know about the use of this Charm and cares to avoid it. If either their parry or their dodge fails, they do not take damage, but the arrow succeeds in stripping their anima and embedding it elsewhere in the scenery. This use of Flashing Sunspot Attack does not allow the Solar to downgrade her own anima, choosing instead to snuff out someone else’s, but may allow her to exploit an opponent’s flaring anima to reveal a retinue of guardian demons or a Throne Shadow assassin nearby. Bonfires created by this Charm last the entire scene before guttering out, and shooting a target with their anima can remove the benefits of Solar's anima power from themselves but does not give it to others."},

Yet none may stand in superiority to the Solar Exalted. Using Yozi-Fighting Principle, the Lawgiver’s killing instinct expands to encompass foes which are armies unto themselves. By conceptualizing all such combatants as intrinsically linked, the character may extend the actions he takes against one opponent to all of them, enabling him to face impossible odds and engage in legendary battles which form the heart of mythology.\nWhile Yozi-Fighting Principle is in effect, any Charm activated against or in response to a networked being is considered to have had its cost pre-paid for use against all other elements of that networked being. This cost discount applies until the Exalt’s next action tick.For example: A Solar is attacked by Ligier and activates a Combo of Heavenly Guardian Defense and Solar Counterattack, paying normally for this defense and counterattack. One tick later, he is subjected to a two-attack flurry by Ligier’s soul, Gervesin. The character may activate Heavenly Guardian Defense and Solar Counterattack for no cost in response to Gervesin’s first attack, but would need to pay for it against his second. Then, one tick after that, Malfeas himself strikes the Solar with a three attack flurry. The Solar may use Solar Counterattack and Heavenly Guardian Defense twice in response to the titan’s onslaught for no cost, but would have to pay a third set of activations.\n“Networked beings” are considered to be creatures whose sum totality of being is encompassed by multiple bodies—Yozis and Primordials are the premiere example, but the Emanations of an unshaped raksha also count. This Charm is effective moving both ‘up’ and ‘down’ a Yozi’s chain of souls—an attack against Gervesin could roll over into a discount against Malfeas as easily as an attack against Malfeas could roll over into a discount against Gervesin. Attacks against Exalted are never discounted, though in the bizarre event that an Exalt somehow began growing subsidiary souls, attacks directed at the Exalt would provide a discount to then target her souls. Exalted akuma form an exception to this rule—they are considered a part of the Yozi they have sold themselves to, and may be fully treated as such by this Charm.

The character’s mind is consumed by the battle-trance. The character cannot speak coherently and cannot retreat.

The Solar may gain motes when confronting an opponent who has defeated the Solar in his present incarnation or any of his past lives. Defeat in this context means physical combat; defeating the Solar in social combat does not qualify, nor does beating him at Gateway or other contests. This Charm does not grant the Exalt special knowledge of defeats that occurred in past lives—the Solar must come by this information by any valid means of doing so.\nThe Lawgiver gains (Essence + 2) motes upon activation, and one additional mote each time his DV refreshes for the rest of the scene. The Solar may only activate this Charm once per scene, and only in battle against one who has defeated him. If the fight concludes with the Exalt’s victory, he has avenged himself, and can no longer activate this Charm against his vanquished opponent until beaten by them again. Otherwise, the Solar may continue to assume Righteous Avenger’s Aspect until he has avenged himself.\nAn inconclusive battle is not sufficient to release a character from the Solar’s vengeance.

Nor does fleeing the Solar release the target from his vengeance.\nAt Essence 3+, the Solar may activate this Charm on behalf of a person or group of people he has a positive Intimacy toward.

{"Title": "Epic Zeal of (Virtue)", "Type of Exalt": "Solar", "Abilities": "Integrity", "Cost": "-", "Mins": {"Integrity": 4, "Essence": 2}, "Type": "Permanent", "Keywords": ["None"], "Duration": "Permanent", "Prerequisite Charms": ["None"], "Description": "In the First Age, the Solars experimented not only with transhumanist biology, but also transhumanist philosophy, seeking to emulate their patron. This is not the only form of extreme Virtue Solars of the First Age explored, only one transhumanist paradigm. Solars can purchase this Charm once per dot of Integrity (to a maximum of four times), with each purchase enhancing one Virtue rated 5+. The choice can’t be altered, but the Charm’s effects recede if the Solar lacks a sufficient Virtue rating for whatever reason. The Solar regains one channel for each Virtue augmented by this Charm once per day at sunset. Additionally, whenever an Solar would roll dice for a Virtue enhanced by a purchase of this Charm (whether as a pool by itself or bonus dice from a channel), the Charm converts these dice into automatic successes. This isn’t optional, so characters must always spend Willpower to resist the urges of extreme Virtue. See below for how Virtues express themselves differently through this Charm.Compassion: The Solar cares for each and every person in Creation, even if she never knew them, and will die trying to protect them. The specifics of the Solar's greater good must be worked out with the Storyteller and must make sense for the character’s Intimacies and other Virtue ratings. In this ethos, she will do anything to save a lives as necessary wage a war to save even a single life, even if it kills millions in the process; but at the same time she won't kill even her worst enemy. She can channel Compassion on any action that serves her sense of justice and impossible compassion. However, she must spend Willpower to take actions to kill anyone.Conviction: Inhuman extremes of Conviction do not wildly deviate from the ethics of mortal paragons except by degree. Therefore, the applicability of Conviction channels does not increase. However, whenever mental influence seeks to alter the emotional context of any of her Intimacies, lessen them outright or alter her beliefs or memory with an Illusion effect, the Exalt may spend one Willpower and one Conviction channel to perfectly dodge that influence. Doing so breaks any ongoing effects from the dodged influence, and this may be done later to throw off influence as an alternative to dodging the initial social attack or other source. In addition to the normal behavioral prohibitions on high Conviction, a Solar with this Charm can’t knowingly act against any of her Intimacies unless she has spent Willpower to act against her beliefs for a scene.Temperance: With extreme self-control comes absolute clarity of purpose. Whenever mental influence would build an Intimacy or exert an Emotion effect over her, the Solar may dodge by spending one Willpower and one Temperance channel. This defense follows the same overall rules as the dodge afforded by Epic Zeal of Conviction apart from the types of influence it defends against. The range of actions that extreme Temperance can enhance does not improve. Unfortunately, her ascetic devotion also requires her to spend Willpower to act dishonestly or show bias in any situation, not just matters of importance. She must also spend Willpower to break promises, even those lacking that formality and solemnity of a sworn oath.Valor: The Solar knows no peers or superiors and, therefore, ceases to understand fear as a meaningful concept. If she would somehow fail a Valor check despite 5+ automatic successes, she still succeeds with threshold of one. She treats all mental influence that would instill fear or alter her behavior through playing on fears as unacceptable orders, also terminating any fear-based Intimacies upon purchase of this Charm. The Storyteller decides when this defense applies. Epic Zeal of Valor does not broaden the range of actions that Valor channels can aid, nor does it broaden the scope of prohibited actions. Interestingly, the Dawn, Dusk, and Slayer Caste anima banner still affect the character, as the Primordial found out during the war, as this doesn't provide immunity to fear, they merely cease to understand it."},

This requires successful prayer roll to the Sun (see Exalted, pg. 138) during which the Solar craftsman designs the prayer into the object in some fashion, typically Old Realm runes or designing the shape to that of the Sun's liking; this always requires some degree of orichalcum though not enough to disrupt the material properties. The Solar need not make the prayer roll himself, but must have been in attendance of the successful prayer before beginning the carving. If this prayer roll fails it can be attempted any number of times before the crafting or repair roll is done or even afterwards with another crafting roll, but the object will not benefit from this Charm without a successful prayer roll.\nOn success and once the object is completed or repaired, it receives benefits based on its form as a Holy effect. For weapons, they permanently inflict aggravated damage to creatures of darkness; armor subtracts the Solar's Essence at the time of crafting from the raw damage of an attack before checking Hardness; objects which provide social benefits to the Solar makes the social attack into unnatural mental influence. A tool or other miscellaneous object blessed by this Charm offers an additional three dice on any opposed roll contested by a creature of darkness. Should the Solar be using a Charm which already provides such benefits when using this object, it instead increases the benefit by two (weapons inflict two bonus damage, armor removes two more damage dice, and the Solar's attacks cost two more Willpower to resist to a max of five).\nFinally, any such object inflicts one die of aggravated damage per tick to a creature of darkness when touching it and can never be attuned to by such beings.\nThis doesn't influence the cost of an Artifact, but most such objects were destroyed or confiscated by the beginning of the Second Age by the Sidereals; having such an object would raise the cost of purchase by one dot (but not the actual rating itself).\nIn the event that the Sun perishes, these weapons lose their potency until the Sun's replacement returns power to Holy Charms. Alternatively, a Solar with the Integrity Charm Should the Sun Not Rise may be used in a replacement prayer to restore power to this.

The character’s discernment of heredity is so keen that he can tell which gente’s bloodline a Terrestrial descends from at a glance.\nAs the Lawgiver grows in experience, so does this Charm’s capabilities.\nAt Essence 5+, the Solar catches physiognomic cues more readily; he can know if people are genetically related just by looking at them, and in what manner; or what a Dragon-Blooded target’s Breeding is and exactly who the Terrestrial is descended from. The Lawgiver is also able to see into spirits; by glancing into a person’s eyes or speaking to them for any length of time, the Lawgiver can see who they were in their former life.\nAt Essence 6+, the Solar need only look at someone while using this Charm to see directly into their soul: the Exalt can see his target’s past 10 incarnations. By using Legacy-Detecting Glance at this level while speaking with Celestial Exalted, the character’s past life memories begin to resonate with the Exaltation before him, discerning the previous bearer of the subject’s Exaltation. If the Lawgiver were to handle an Exaltation in Lytek’s office directly while using this Charm, he could discern the identity of every person to have contained that Exaltation. At Essence 7+, the Lawgiver can use this Charm to see directly into a targeted Chosen’s Exaltation and discern all of the bearer’s past incarnations; alternately, he may examine the subject’s soul and witness its last 100 incarnations.\nAt Essence 8+ the Solar may examine a subject’s soul and trace its reincarnation history all the way to the beginning.\nWhen activating this Charm, the Solar may choose to look into the genetic, mimetic, or Exalted history of his subject, but not all three at once.\nThe benefits of this Charm extend beyond genealogical trivia.

They stood at the edge of the world and forced shape into the teeth of the howling storm. This Charm forces a region of the Wyld to take form as the Exalt commands.Wyld-Shaping Technique is an extended dramatic action. The dice pool used equals (the Solar’s Intelligence + Lore). Each roll requires five hours of effort, and the character pays the Charm’s cost with each roll. This roll has a base difficulty of 1 in regions of Pure Chaos, 3 in the Deep Wyld, 5 in the Middlemarches, and 7 in the Bordermarches of the Wyld.\nWhen the Lawgiver has accumulated a sufficient number of successes, she must spend them all at once, ending the Charm. Unspent successes are wasted. Successes may be spent in the following manner:Land, exotic wonders, and wealth created with Wyld-Shaping Technique are not quite fully real in and of themselves. Their reality stems from Creation—from the reality of the Lawgivers, the Imperial Mountain, and the Loom of Fate. As long as the created things continue to interact with things of Creation, as through the magical trade networks established in the Old Realm to tame the Wyld, they survive. If something created by this Charm fails to interact extensively with the things of Creation during a story, it begins to lose its reality. Roll its creator’s Essence against either difficulty 1, or, if the Solar’s creation does not interact with reality at all during the story, difficulty 2. After three consecutive failures during which the creation does not interact with things of reality extensively, wonders and wealth cease to exist. Land becomes a Wyld-infected zone of the severity it held before being Wyld-Shaped. Exotic wonders forged into artifacts are always considered to be interacting with reality by virtue of being integrated into an artifact.\nIndividuals created with this are not subject to withering away when out of contact with things of Creation, but are not fully integrated into Creation’s cycles of life and death, either. Their soul is an artificial thing forged of compressed and calcified chaos, and will attempt to return to that state upon death—they cannot leave behind a ghost or reincarnate unless Heaven takes steps to specifically incorporate the individual into the cycle of reincarnation. Wyld-Shaped heroic individuals are potentially eligible for Exaltation, although the Solars of the Old Realm were never able to confirm or debunk this fact to their satisfaction. Exaltation immediately completes the soul of a Wyld-Shaped hero, ensuring that it will continue on beyond death as normal.\nRaksha who find themselves within Wyld-Shaped landscape which has not interacted with any Creation-born for one season and which currently contains no Creation-born may launch a Shaping attack against the landscape as though it were a waypoint. Success will cause the landscape to automatically fail its next stability roll. Activating Wyld-Shaping Technique sends enormous ripples out through the local Wyld, automatically alerting all Fair Folk within five journeys that the Charm is being used, and where."},

III—Yu-Shan, pp.122-124) The spirit always has the Bane Weapon Charm, which is efficacious against other spirits of the disease it represents, and a special Charm called Consume Sickness, which allows the spirit to spend 10 motes to draw out the sickness it represents from a person and consume it, gaining a point of Willpower or restocking a Virtue channel in the process. This Charm may only function if a number of individuals of Magnitude 6 or above are infected with the disease within the targeted area."},

Spirits normally dissipate rather than dying when they lose all of their health levels to damage. The Solar invokes this Charm after making a successful attack that damages or dissipates a spirit. In addition to the normal damage from this attack, this Charm remove a number of motes from the spirit. If the spirit loses its last health level to this attack and dissipates, this Charm consumes the spirit utterly. Its Essence dissolves, and it will never be remade. This equally works against anything unkillable, immortal, or so forth, like that of a behemoth, such as Oliphem or Juggernaut. The only thing this doesn't permanently destroy is the Neverborn, and their servants the Deathlords whose power flows through them, everything else is killed; any such power that prevents them from dying, whether Charm, necromancy, sorcery, or such all fail to prevent their destruction, killing the unkillable.\nThis Charm cannot drain more motes from a spirit than the total levels of damage dealt by the attack. Motes drained do not go into the Solar’s Essence pool; rather, these torn-off fragments of spiritual power swirl invisibly about her, empowering her to continue her assault upon unruly spirits. For each mote drained by this Charm, the Solar may launch one Spirit-Cutting Attack at no mote cost. Phantasmal images of those spirits damaged or destroyed by Ghost-Eating Technique during the scene flicker and churn within the Solar’s anima until she has used up all captured Essence on Spirit-Cutting Attacks, or until the end of the scene, at which point the drained power dissipates.\nThis Charm is a natural property of the Exaltation, something that only Autochthon could have devised, and thus can only be used by them and no one else; many beings may possess functionally similar powers."},

These things become valid targets for the character’s visual Awareness rolls, including reflexive visual Awareness rolls.\nThe ability to perceive Essence patterns has the following effects: All Charms are treated as Obvious with respect to the character. Dematerialized and invisible creatures and effects are considered visible. The character recognizes all artifacts, manses, demesnes, and dragon lines as such. The character can automatically recognize a creature with Essence 4+ as a supernatural creature. The character can recognize the Essence type of anything they see and their approximate mote pool. Essence type of attuned artifacts, manses, demesnes, dragon lines, and personal Essence type are visually colored by the type of Essence following through them: Water Essence appears midnight blue, Air is sky blue, Fire is red, Wood is forest green, and Earth is chalk white. Lunar Essence gleams argent, Solar is golden, Sidereal produces a shifting chromatic pattern, Nocturnal Essence has a purple night sky hue dotted with stars, Abyssal Essence is pitch black, and Yozi Essence carry strange and abnormal patterns based on the Yozi. Artifacts and Essence users (including the Exalted, the Mountain Folk, the Dragon Kings, mortal thaumaturges who have learned to unlock their Essence, etc.) have a faint anima of their type surrounding and filling them, representing their type and apparent mote value.\nIf the character makes a deliberate attempt and action to analyze what he sees, this Charm allows an (Intelligence + Occult) roll to do so. Identifying the exact effects of an unknown Charm, artifact, spell, Procedure, or magical power is difficulty 5. A known one is merely difficulty 2. Gauging the rating of a person’s Essence trait, exact remaining motes, a demesne, a manse, or an artifact has difficulty 2.\nCharacters using Stealth to avoid detection are not automatically revealed by their Charms, spells, magical power, Essence trait, type, or mote pool, or carried artifacts, for the same reason that colorful clothing does not automatically void mundane attempts at stealth. Instead, add the target’s Essence in dice to any attempt by the character to pierce mundane or magical Stealth. Similarly, this Charm does not automatically void mundane or magical disguises and similar deceptions, and provides the same bonus to see through them, along with always giving the opportunity to see through them. Piercing a disguise doesn't reveal who or what the target is, just merely that they are disguised. Failing to see through a magical disguise results in the Solar seeing what the disguised is designed to show for such things, meaning that a Charm being used for a disguise cannot be identified until it is pierced, along with their Essence rating, type, mote pools, and supernatural status.\nThis benefit doesn't extend to mundane disguises and thoroughly examining someone might reveal indirectly that they are disguised, such as if their Essence rating or type was wrong for the disguise. If a Solar was using one of his combat Charms while wearing a mundane disguise of a Dragon-Blooded, a user of this Charm could notice his Essence doesn't match that of a Dragon-Blooded."},

Sometimes waiting for Calibration—or even sundown—is an affront to the Lawgivers, as if to mock them for the mercies they once accorded. This Charm enhances the spells Demon of the First Circle. At Essence 6+, this power includes Demon of the Second Circle. At Essence 7+, this Charm’s power expands to encompass Demons of the Third Circle as well. When casting one of these spells, the Solar may spend an extra 10 motes and one Willpower to gain the following benefits: The casting time of the spell is reduced to a single hour, and the dramatic action used to shape this spell may begin at any hour of the day and on any day of the year. The concentrated power of the Solar’s will visibly strains the boundaries of existence, causing a localized Calibration more ominous and bizarre than the natural fixing of Creation that marks the beginning and end of each year. For an area of (100 yards for a First Circle demon, 500 for Second Circle demon, and one mile for a Third Circle demon) around her, sunlight bleeds away as surely as the coming of midnight, and sounds somewhere between great hollow wails of torment and the grating of brass echoes out from her location. The Bureau of Destiny is made explicitly aware every time this Charm is used to enhance a summoning, and knows where it was used.\nWhenever this Charm is used to summon a demon of the Third Circle outside of Calibration, the Solar must reflexively make a contested roll of his (Intelligence + Occult) against the Dodge MDV of each Third Circle demon he has currently bound. Failing this roll for a single demon permits all currently bound demons to slip free of their bindings.\nThis Charm also enhances Summon Elemental with the same cost, though without the darkening, the Calibration effect, or informing the Bureau of Destiny. It does not allow the elemental to send a proxy unless it was imprisoned by a being greater than the Solar, like an Incarnae, or the Solar allows them. It also reduces the time to summon to a mere half hour, rushing the elemental across Creation, and explicitly tells the elemental that he is being summoned by the Chosen of the Sun on urgent business. If the Solar allows the being to send a proxy, it instead summons (the Solar’s Essence) number instead, unless the elemental lacks that many to send in which case it sends as many as it can. Otherwise, the spell functions as normal the Solar performs a clash of will against each, but only rolls once for themselves and applies dice reduction to all the elementals being bound.For example: The Solar cannot summon more than one of the Kukla’s guards, but could summon one in thirty minutes if needed. If he desired to call the Censor of the West, he could force them to appear or (his Essence rating) number of underlings that the Censor has instead."},

If the target is a creature of darkness, the sun’s heat stifles them even indoors or at night; the character suffers a -1 external penalty to all actions while this Charm remains in effect. If in direct sunlight, such wretches suffer a blistering heat environmental effect (see Exalted, p. 131).\nAt Essence 6+ the Solar may use an enhanced version of this Charm costing six motes. Used in this fashion, all targets suffer the effects reserved for creatures of darkness, above. Additionally, if the Solar voluntarily ends this Charm by withdrawing committed Essence, creatures of darkness spontaneously combust in a blaze of sunfire, suffering a one-time environmental damage effect with Damage 10A, Trauma 5.\nWith Essence 7+, the Solar may issue a summons to targets afflicted with either version of this Charm, so long as they are within one mile of her. The summons is Obvious to the target’s senses, as is the location where the Solar expects to meet (also within the same one-mile radius). The target has one day to reach this meeting point, and must arrive in broad daylight. Should she fail to do so, she will be branded with the creature of darkness. At this level Solars may also target mortals with Falling Sun Eyes simply by speaking their name, dispensing with the Touch Keyword. This is a favored method used by the Night Caste to summon alleged criminals to face trial by the law. Unless a Solar is already marked as a creature of darkness, he cannot be made a creature of darkness by this Charm without approval from the Unconquered and this Charm draws his attention if he so chooses to allow for such immediate judgement if he wishes."},

He does not know things that only the target can know, however, so he cannot give passwords or issue countersigns. Circumstances, such as a Solar not knowing the name of wife of the man he's disguised as that an investigator knows the man should know, would be counted as extraordinary and thus allow for a roll as normal to pierce through the lie.

This Charm is identical to the Dragon-Blooded Charm Craft Icon.\nAt Essence 4+, this Charm may go even further, allowing it to encode Training effects into a highly dense rune. To do so, the character meditates upon a Charm or spell she knows, and then designs a single glyph encompassing the totality of her understanding of the effect. This glyph transcends language and its meaning may be effortlessly intuited by any character capable of learning the Charm or spell the glyph is based upon. Beautiful Essence-Born Runes contain more than simply instructions in the use of a Charm or spell, however; when created, they are also designed to encompass additional lessons desired by their creator. In game terms, each glyph contains one Charm or spell, and one Intimacy. Thereafter, characters who study the glyph may learn the spell or Charm coded into it a single scene, as a Training effect. However, the character also gains the Intimacy coded into the Charm, and it is fundamentally embedded into her understanding of the magic till the Intimacy erodes.\nDesigning a rune takes only (minimum Essence of effect) hours of effort, and a character may design an unlimited number of runes.

All observers who witness the ship see it as a friendly vessel, if possible—its sails display friendly colors, and its sailors seem to be of the proper origin and nationality. Pirates and other nautical predators instead see a ship that is too poor to bother assaulting, or too formidable to consider boarding. This unnatural mental influence costs four points of Willpower to see through. The disguise has one major flaw—the ship’s reflection upon the waves shows its true nature. Solars are thus advised not to sail too close to other vessels when relying upon this Charm."},
{"Title": "Mariner's Parable Defense", "Type of Exalt": "Solar", "Abilities": "Sail", "Cost": "6m", "Mins": {"Sail": 5, "Essence": 3}, "Type": "Simple", "Keywords": ["Emotion", "Illusion"], "Duration": "Indefinite", "Prerequisite Charms": ["Ship-Claiming Stance"], "Description": "The Solar’s vessel shouts his legend into the world. This Charm may only be used aboard a ship the Solar owns. The identity of the vessel’s owner becomes Obvious to all characters who perceive it. Should they be unaware of the Solar by reputation or personal association, Mariner’s Parable Defense makes it clear—the Exalt is a legendary man of the sea: a hero who sinks pirates, rescues damsels in distress, puts storm gods in their place, braves hurricanes and defies the Yozis; or a peerless pirate who ransacks port towns, evades capture with a laugh, and steals comely lads or lasses with as much ease and abandon as casks of jade. Should the Solar’s ship put into port while this Charm is in effect, this aura follows the character wherever he should go, up to (Essence) miles from the ship.\nCommon folk marvel at the Solar’s heroism or cringe before his rapacity—he raises his Appearance and MDVs by three with regard to all characters struck by this aura. Additionally, fear of the Solar’s prowess imposes a -1 external penalty to all attacks directed at his person or his ship. This unnatural mental influence costs two Willpower to resist for a scene.\nAdditionally, the Solar gains one temporary dot of Influence while this Charm is active."},

For the duration of a scene, the Dragon-Blood can double his ship’s rate of movement. If the ship is forced to take a path through dangerous waters at its accelerated speed, Sail rolls are not required to maintain control of the ship and keep it from running aground. This Charm can enhance any Sail vehicle, doubling the speed of its propulsion. Vehicles lacking propulsion receive no benefit; a massive caravan wagon without teams of yeddim to pull it is as helpless as a becalmed ship."},

In addition, each scene the deathknight spends commanding his crew counts as a scene of building an Intimacy of submissive fear in them unless they have an Essence rating equal to or greater than his own. Those who develop such Intimacies cannot take any actions that would knowingly result in harm to their captain or remove him from his position while aboard a ship he owns, unless they spend two Willpower points per day to overcome the unnatural mental influence of this Charm.New Solar Charm: Crew-Inspiring Charisma (Prerequisites: Salty Dog Method; Exalted, p. 236). The Solar Mirror to this Charm builds Intimacies of adoration to deter mutiny rather than terror, but otherwise operates the same way."},

All individuals with a Dodge MDV lower than half the Solar’s (Charisma + Socialize + Essence) who behold the character and have no reason to regard him with hostility are inclined to respect him, gaining an automatic Intimacy of admiration toward the Lawgiver.

As a geomancer might change the landscape to create a demesne, or an acupuncturist use needles to correct a patient’s essence meridians, so too can the Solar shape the essence of a business with holidays and rewards.Servant-Rewarding Benevolence is a dramatic action to provide benefit to the members of a social and/or mass combat unit. If the Solar is not the unit’s leader, the unit’s rank and file must officially recognize the Lawgiver’s authority to provide the benefits in question. The action can be anything that would logically make unit members happier. Examples include offering one-time bonus pay, offering a state holiday off work or taking a legion out for a wild night on the town.\nFor a month following the enchanted special occasion, the Charm provides the following benefits:"}
