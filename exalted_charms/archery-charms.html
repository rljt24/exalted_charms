<h1 id="toc0"><span>Core Rule Book</span></h1>
<h2 id="toc1"><span>There is No Wind</span></h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 1m or 3m; <strong>Mins</strong>: Archery 1, Essence 1;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Reflexive (Step 1)<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Martial<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Instant<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: None<br />
The Solar’s heart knows the arrow’s path. She spends three motes and fires a single flawless shot, regardless of distance, visibility, weather and other prevailing conditions. This Charm nullifies all penalties applying to a single attack. This Charm does not negate DVs as DVs are not penalties.<br />
If the Solar has Essence 3 or higher, she can spend two additional motes and this Charm will increase the Range of her weapon to her maximum visibility range.<br />
<em>Martial</em>: Martial Arts, Melee, Thrown; The Essence 3+ upgrade does not apply to Martials Arts or Melee.</p>
<h2 id="toc2"><span>Accuracy Without Distance</span></h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 4m, 1wp; <strong>Mins</strong>: Archery 5, Essence 3;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Reflexive (Step 1)<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Obvious<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Instant<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: There is No Wind<br />
The Solar fires a single perfect shot. The Exalt spends this Charm’s cost and fires an arrow at a valid target. This Charm supplements the player’s Archery attack and guarantees that the attack hits. This Charm can be used in archery contests and for trick shots, such as severing a rope from afar, but it is most often used in attacks. Resolve such attacks normally. If the attack would have missed without this Charm, then it hits, calculating its raw damage based on an assumption of 0 attack threshold successes. This Charm does not change the normal rules for valid targets, shooting “the gap in his armor” does not allow the Exalt to bypass armor soak, nor does this Charm allow the Exalt to fire through a stone wall or beyond the maximum Range of his bow without additional magic.<br />
At Essence 4+, this Charm changes to become the following. For 4m, the attack becomes undodgeable or unblockable. For 10m, the attack becomes undodgeable <em>and</em> unblockable. For a Willpower surcharge to either, the attack automatically scores a threshold of 0 successes on the attack if it fails to hit as described above.</p>
<h2 id="toc3"><span>Forceful Arrow</span></h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 1m; <strong>Mins</strong>: Archery 2, Essence 2;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Supplemental<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Knockback, Obvious<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Instant<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: There is No Wind<br />
Essence imbues the Lawgiver’s arrow with great force. This Charm supplements an Archery-based attack. If the attack hits the attack and not negated by Hardness then it knocks the enemy away from the Exalt a number of yards equal to the Exalt’s Essence x 3. Objects are knocked back if (the raw damage x 50) exceeds the object’s weight in pounds. A character who has learned the Charm <em>Lightning Strikes Twice</em> may apply the effects of that Charm to a knockback caused by Forceful Arrow.</p>
<h2 id="toc4"><span>Trance of Unhesitating Speed</span></h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 5m; <strong>Mins</strong>: Archery 3, Essence 2;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Extra Action<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Mirror (Withering Feathered Maelstrom)<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Instant<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: None<br />
The ideal archer flows with soft and unhesitating grace through the motions of firing her weapon. This Charm is a magical flurry of two or more Archery-based attacks. The Exalt can buy up to (her permanent Essence + 3) attacks. This Charm lets the Solar make these attacks regardless of the weapon’s Rate and does not count against it, doesn't have multiple action penalties accumulated between attacks, Speed and DV penalty equal to the highest of any individual attack, and only counting as one action for multiple action penalties, suffering the highest multiple action penalty performed from any one action.</p>
<h2 id="toc5"><span>Arrow Storm Technique</span></h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 3m; <strong>Mins</strong>: Archery 2, Essence 2;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Simple (Speed 5, DV -1)<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Obvious<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Instant<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Trance of Unhesitating Speed<br />
Against a single Solar, the armies of the unrighteous fall. This Charm is an Archery-based attack. The Solar can apply this attack (for which he rolls only once) against (his permanent Essence x 3) valid targets. He cannot apply this attack to a single person or human-sized object more than once, but he can apply it repeatedly against the same military unit or larger object. This Charm requires that the character have separate ammunition for each target. The character can use this Charm even with weapons such as firewands that would normally require a reloading action between shots.</p>
<h2 id="toc6"><span>Flashing Vengeance Draw</span></h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: - (3m); <strong>Mins</strong>: Archery 2, Essence 2;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Martial-Ready, Mirror (Doom Drawn and Imminent)<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Trance of Unhesitating Speed<br />
To assault the Chosen of the Unconquered Sun is folly. Their retribution is swift and terrible. The Exalt must have an Archery weapon available for use to invoke this Charm, but it need not be in her hands. If the character rolls the highest Join Battle at the start of the fight, the first attack he makes following Join Battle is unexpected. The Solar must gain the highest result; ties spoil this effect.<br />
This Charm enhances the Join Battle action for three motes, giving the Solar a number of bonus successes on the Join Battle roll equal to her Essence and immediately and reflexively draws and readies an available weapon.<br />

The character charges an arrow with Essence. The effects are based on the character’s fighting style and anima. This Charm always adds the character’s Essence in damage to an Archery-based attack. In addition, players can pick one of the following effects when purchasing this Charm.<br />
<strong>Fiery Arrow Attack</strong>: The Solar’s arrow (or appropriate ammunition) catches fire mid-flight, gaining the F tag. If the Solar’s Archery-based attack strikes a flammable material, this Charm ensures that it ignites. This Charm always destroys wooden ammunition when it’s used.<br />
<strong>Dazzling Flare</strong>: The Solar’s arrow (or other ammunition) glows with holy fire or brilliant sunlight. This Charm makes the Solar’s Archery-based attack Holy, and it inflicts aggravated damage against creatures of darkness (see p. 192). The arrow shines brightly enough to be seen for (the Solar’s Essence x 10) miles, if fired straight upward or otherwise unobstructed.<br />
<strong>Righteous Judgment Arrow</strong>: The Solar can spend a third mote on this Charm to add four extra dice of damage to the attack. This variation has a distinctive visual effect usually related to the character’s anima. <em>For example, if a Twilight’s anima display shows a mandala of blue and gold light, her Righteous Judgment Arrow might have streamers of blue and gold that congeal into a mandala symbol in front of the target as the arrow hits.</em><br />
Characters can purchase additional effects for this Charm at a cost of one experience point each or one bonus point for both.</p>

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Essence Arrow Attack<br />
The bane of the mortal archer is her dependence on ammunition, but Lawgivers can use this Charm to shape sparkling arrows of Essence. This Charm permits a Lawgiver to make ranged attacks without using ammunition. Each such attack costs one mote of Essence. The Exalt can attack as if using any form of ammunition without Resources cost, such as a broadhead, fowling, frog crotch, or target arrow. This Charm permanently enhances the Exalt’s capabilities. Therefore, shaping motes into ammunition is an unrolled reflexive action and not a Charm activation and isn’t committed Essence.<br />
As a point of clarification, this Charm can generate ammo for Essence based weapons like essence cannons and implosion bows cheaper than the weapon’s ability to generate ammo. Such systems are for mortal use.</p>

The Solar’s weapons know their master. The Solar holds out her hand and calls to the Essence of one of her weapons. If the desired weapon is within (Essence x 10) yards, and a flight path exists between the weapon and her hand, this Charm draws the weapon into her grasp. She must own the weapon she calls and spend a mote to call it. This Charm can be used to draw and ready a sheathed weapon reflexively, including in Elsewhere.<br />

The Chosen may set aside their weapons for a time, but a life of peace can never be their fate. The Solar first draws a ranged weapon that he owns, this Charm banishes that weapon to Elsewhere. The Solar can then draw the weapon directly from Elsewhere later, using a miscellaneous action. The Charm ends when he does so. If he cancels the Essence committed to this Charm while the weapon is Elsewhere, the weapon falls to the ground at his side. This Charm can banish only objects (including artifacts) deliberately created as ranged weapons. Ammo for such a weapon can be stored for 0m.<br />

The Solar’s quiver holds the arrows of the sun. This Charm allows the Solar to shape ammo from ambient Essence at will for the remainder of the scene. Doing so functions as Phantom Arrow Technique but does not cost one mote of Essence per arrow.<br />
This Charm also permanently upgrades its prerequisite so it can create expensive ammunition like firedust charges and plasma tongue repeater ammo in addition to the normal ammunition options. It cannot create Artifact ammunition or anything more complex than thaumaturgical ammo. Ammunition created by this upgrade adds one die to its normal damage and never strikes an unintended target. It will stop in midair for an instant before vanishing rather than hurt someone the Solar wishes spared.</p>

The Solar shapes his Essence into a firewand. This Charm is identical to Glorious Solar Saber, except that it creates artifact firewands and similar weapons.

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Essence Arrow Attack<br />
Essence multiplies the force of the Lawgiver’s blow. This Charm creates duplicates of the Exalt’s Archery-based attack, usually meaning that one arrow or firewand charge becomes several in flight. The Solar spends three motes per duplicate attack and can create up to (her permanent Essence score) duplicate attacks. Treat the original attack and all duplicates as a single attack when making attack and defense rolls, but if they hit, calculate the damage for each attack separately. All duplicates fade after the attack.</p>

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Essence Arrow Attack<br />
The Lawgiver’s arrow detonates in a searing flare as it hits. If an attack enhanced by this Charm successfully strikes its target, then the target is surrounded by a one-time environmental damage effect with a radius of (Essence x 5) yards, Damage (Essence x 2)L and Trauma (Essence). This damage is doubled against structures. If the Solar or anyone they wish spared is caught within the radius of this effect, she is immune to it. The explosion produced by this Charm will not harm any characters she does not wish it to. At Essence 6+, the environmental field’s Damage upgrades to (Essence x 4)L. At Essence 7+, this expands its radius to (Essence x 50) yards. This benefit upgrades to (Essence x 100) yards at Essence 8+.</p>

This Charm acts as a permanent upgrade to <em>Phantom Arrow Technique</em>, granting the benefits of all known <em>Essence Arrow Attack</em> technique to attacks produced with ammunition created with <em>Phantom Arrow Technique</em>. The Solar may still activate <em>Essence Arrow Attack</em> to benefit from them again on any attack.</p>

Though he flees to Heaven or to Hell, the target cannot escape the Lawgiver’s arrows. Tilting her head back to feel sunlight on her face, the Solar squints and fires one shot toward her Celestial patron. That shot will strike the target as long as the target is under an open sky, be he in Malfeas, the Underworld, the Wyld, Yu-Shan, or anywhere else. The archer need not know where her enemy is, but she may attack a given distant target thus only once until she sees him again. This Charm acts as a permanent upgrade to Accuracy Without Distance whose benefits cost 9m, 1wp to activate. It explicitly can’t be used at night or indoors, and won’t hit indoor targets.<br />
A second purchase, at Essence 6+, permits the Charm to attack a target up to five times before the Solar sees him again. A third purchase permits the Lawgiver to use this Charm whenever she stands in sunlight, and to target her enemies so long as they are exposed to any degree of sunlight; thus are the enemies of the greatest of the Chosen forced to dwell in absolute darkness forever. The Solar is still required to have met the person.<br />
This Charm doesn’t work against people the Solar has met that have masked their identity from him, such as a Lunar or a Night Caste. The Solar must have met the person and know who they are for it to work. Should the person abandon their identity, or have no identity it will not work and the cost is refunded.</p>

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: There Is No Wind<br />
The Solar's heart is a storm that gathers power in the idle moments between life and death. This Charm gives the Solar one mote per action when the Solar is outside the engagement range of all of his enemies. The Solar must be in battle to gain this benefit. After gaining five motes from this Charm, the mote drip ends.<br />
Once the storm has rolled in and vented its wrath, it moves back out to sea to fill its quiver with new lightning. The Solar may renew this Charm’s benefit by moving into the engagement range of at least one opponent and remaining there for a full action. While there, he must make at least one attack against that or any other opponent rolled into combat. Doing so will reestablish the mote drip as soon as the Lawgiver moves out of the engagement range of all opponents. This practice may be repeated an unlimited number of times throughout the course of battle.</p>

<strong>Keywords</strong>: Counterattack, Obvious<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Instant<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Forceful Arrow<br />
A Solar’s mastery of archery extends beyond bow and string and arrow, making her entire body part of the momentum of the shot and the art of the kill. This Charm permits the character to channel her shot’s momentum into her own body. The Solar immediately fires off an arrow and flies back (Archery x 3) yards. If the Solar doesn't have ammo to fire, he cannot use this Charm. This Charm is treated as a counterattack, even though the jump is not hostile. It reduces the character’s DV by one, and it is resolved in Step 9 of attack resolution. This Charm can explicitly be used with a Counterattack Charm if he uses it to make an Archery attack and inflicts the higher of the two Charms' DV penalty.</p>
<h2 id="toc22"><span>Flashing Sunspot Attack</span></h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 1-3m; <strong>Mins</strong>: Archery 3, Essence 3;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Reflexive (Step 1)<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Native<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Instant<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: None<br />
Master archers have been known to snuff out candles with a shot from their bow. But the skill of the Lawgivers is such as to smother bonfires with a single arrow. This Charm has two uses. The one mote version enhances an Archery attack, preventing any peripheral motes spent on the attack from adding to the character’s anima banner. In addition, if the attack does health levels of damage to the target, that target’s anima display rises by a number of motes commensurate to the peripheral motes spent on the attack. Because the Solar is shooting out her own anima, this Charm expressly allows her to tag non-Exalted opponents with anima displays. All targets struck with <em>Flashing Sunspot Attack</em> suffer the same Stealth deficiencies as characters flaring their anima banners (see Exalted, p. 114).<br />
The second use of this Charm folds into the first use: the character may spend one mote to activate this Charm. However, instead of attacking a particular opponent, she may fire her anima into the scenery in an attempt to uncover hidden opponents. As above, any additional peripheral motes she spends on this activation are voided. Upon making this shot, her current anima display automatically drops down a level. Where her arrow lands, it creates a heatless bonfire of the Solar’s anima 50 yards in diameter, ending all concealment magic in the area and making stealth in the vicinity of the flare impossible. A Solar in the 8-10 range of anima display may choose instead to pay two motes to make this shot, dropping her down two full levels and creating a bonfire 100 yards in diameter. By paying a third mote, the Solar can void an 11-15 mote display, creating a bonfire 200 yards in diameter. Characters who use this Charm to drop their anima into the 1-3 range are considered to have spent only a single mote of peripheral Essence for the purposes of rebuilding their anima banner.<br />
At Essence 4+, the Solar may use the one mote version of this Charm to move bonfires she has created by shooting through them. The blaze is snuffed out by the arrow’s passage, and reappears wherever the arrow lands. At Essence 5+, this Charm reveals the presence of dematerialized spirits and demons within the area of the bonfire. In addition, the Lawgiver may shoot out the anima of other characters, using the same mote costs to downgrade their anima as she would to void her own display. In this instance, the Lawgiver’s shot need not hit the character in question; merely passing close by is enough to puff out someone’s Essence candle. Her arrow snuffs her target’s anima display and deposits it wherever the shot lands, creating a bonfire as if she were shooting out her own anima.<br />
Characters wishing to defend against having their anima snuffed may cut the arrow from its course with a successful parry, or may move their anima from its course through a successful dodge, assuming they know about the use of this Charm and cares to avoid it. If either their parry or their dodge fails, they do not take damage, but the arrow succeeds in stripping their anima and embedding it elsewhere in the scenery. This use of <em>Flashing Sunspot Attack</em> does not allow the Solar to downgrade her own anima, choosing instead to snuff out someone else’s, but may allow her to exploit an opponent’s flaring anima to reveal a retinue of guardian demons or a Throne Shadow assassin nearby. Bonfires created by this Charm last the entire scene before guttering out, and shooting a target with their anima can remove the benefits of Solar's anima power from themselves but does not give it to others.</p>

A Solar may learn to master all angles, trajectories, and speeds of attack—even those of his enemy. This Charm takes effect when the Solar is targeted by an attack, telling him the exact range and position of the character that made the attack. This does not allow the Solar to see his opponent; instead, his superior throwing skills allow him to calculate the angle of attack, making a perfect estimation of his assailant’s position.<br />
At Essence 3+, the Solar gains a taste for the Essence signature of his attacker; when faced with more than one opponent whom he cannot see, the Exalt may tell the difference between them, even if they are constantly changing positions. This does not confer information about the identity of his attackers; he simply knows them by their attacks, making it possible to hone in on a particular opponent under changing conditions.<br />

A pulse of blinding white Essence explodes outward from the Solar’s bullet as it hits its mark. Attacks enhanced with this Charm's prerequisite gain one level of the Piercing tag.

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Nova Shell Ordnance<br />
The Essence of a Solar’s righteous wrath suffuses his weapon as his finger falls upon the trigger, superheating the chambered round until it glows a bright cherry-red. <em>Searing Radiance Fire Tongues</em> adds the Solar’s (Essence) in dice to the post-soak damage of a supplemented attack. Any flammable materials struck by a superheated bullet catch flame.<br />
Against creatures of darkness damaged by this attack, the Solar’s bullet continues to burn in their wound until the end of the scene, its wrathful flame stoked by the blood of the world’s enemies. Every time the wounded target’s DV refreshes, they take one die of unsoakable aggravated damage as a tongue of flame bursts from their wounds, bypassing Hardness. This effect is both Holy and Crippling. Removing the embedded bullet to end this requires a difficulty 3 (Dexterity + Medicine) roll as a miscellaneous action.</p>

<strong>Keywords</strong>: Emotion, Obvious<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Instant<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Nova Shell Ordnance<br />
The Solar fires his weapon into the air, magnifying the sound of the shot through his anima until it is as the terrifying roar of thunder. The Solar rolls (Charisma + Performance) as an unblockable social attack against all enemies within the base Range of his weapon, adding automatic successes equal to his (Archery) rating. Any character whose MDV is exceeded by the roll succumbs to an unnatural Emotion of fear, forcing them to spend the rest of the scene fleeing from the Solar. On every tick, they must take a Move action to move as far away as possible from him, although they are never forced to move through an area that would cause harm to them (such as a bonfire or off a cliff). Affected characters can still take other actions normally.<br />
Resisting this unnatural mental influence costs three Willpower. Once a character has run outside the base Range of the Solar’s firearm, he may pay one point of Willpower for partial resistance, allowing him to stop running as long as he remains outside that weapon’s Range. Extras and wild animals are unable to resist this influence.</p>

The Solar gunslinger’s eye is infallible as it gauges the distance and sets its mark. Heaven’s Eye Marksmanship adds 150 yards to the Range of the supplemented attack. As a peerless marksman, the Solar also adds an additional 50 yards for each die added to the attack from Aiming, and adds all Aim dice to raw damage as well as the attack roll.</p>

Essence and martial perfection come together in an instant of unsurpassed speed as the Solar fires too fast for his enemies to defend. His hand is a blur, drawing and firing faster than a heartbeat. Such is the speed of the Solar’s gunslinging that any DV applied against the supplemented attack is halved. If necessary, he can reflexively ready a Firearms weapon before making the attack.<br />
With Essence 4+, the Solar’s reflexes heighten in response to the thrill of danger. As long as he is within the engagement range of his target, he can pay an additional two motes to make the attack undodgeable.</p>

The world stills for a moment as the Solar gunslinger locks eyes with a foe. His fighting spirit redoubles as he calls his foe out with a shouted taunt, a menacing gesture, or a dramatic gun cock. From that moment on, the fight is between them alone. <em>Divine Showdown Style</em> can be activated to issue a challenge to any enemy who is a heroic character. The challenge has the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Solar gains a single mote each time he damages the chosen enemy with an Archery attack.</li>
<li>On any tick in which the Solar is attacked by enemies other than the one he challenged, he gains a single mote.</li>
<li>If the challenged enemy falls Incapacitated or retreats from the scene of combat, the Solar gains motes equal to the target's (Essence), and this Charm ends.</li>
<li>The Solar loses a single mote any time he attacks a character other than the challenged enemy, unless they attacked him on their last action.</li>

A Lawgiver may double his glory in battle, wielding twin guns with superhuman precision. While dual-wielding Firearms weapons with this Charm active, the Solar suffers no off-hand penalties. In addition, each weapon ignores the first (Essence) points of multiple action penalties and the Solar suffers only half the normal multiple action penalty when making Archery attacks.<br />
<em>Sundog Gunslinger Stance</em> also enhances other Solar Charms while it is active. <em>Lightning Hands Reload</em> can be used to reflexively reload two different weapons once each round, and <em>Flashing Vengeance Draw</em> allows the Solar to reflexively draw two weapons when he rolls Join Battle.</p>

Once each action, the Solar can reflexively reload a readied weapon at no cost, trusting his lightning reflexes and well-honed muscle memory. With a stunt, he can reflexively reload even without a free hand. Additionally the Solar can spend one mote to lower the Speed of his attack by one, to a minimum of 3, and raise the Rate of his attack weapon by one until his next action.</p>

Fools who draw down the wrath of the Solar Exalted had best be prepared to dance with the thunder. This Charm upgrades the prerequisite, adding a drawn weapon’s Accuracy rating to his roll as bonus dice (maximum +4 dice) from equipment. In addition, any Archery attack the Solar makes on his first action tick of the scene adds an additional three dice, as if he spent three ticks Aiming, on the attack roll as long as he attacks a character who has not yet received an action tick in combat. These count as dice from Aiming, not as bonus dice from Charms.</p>
