The maneuver named the Iron Whirlwind Attack conserves Essence but requires an utmost exertion of will. This Charm is a magical flurry of many Melee-based attacks. The Exalt makes a total number of attacks equal to (her Essence + 3). This Charm lets the Solar make these attacks regardless of the weapon’s Rate and does not count against it, doesn't have multiple action penalties accumulated between attacks, Speed and DV penalty equal to the highest of any individual attack, and only counting as one action for multiple action penalties, suffering the highest multiple action penalty performed from any one attack.</p>

The Solar’s weapons know their master. The Solar holds out her hand and calls to the Essence of one of her weapons. If the desired weapon is within (Essence x 10) yards, and a flight path exists between the weapon and her hand, this Charm draws the weapon into her grasp. She must own the weapon she calls and spend a mote to call it. This Charm can be used to draw and ready a sheathed weapon reflexively, including in Elsewhere.<br />

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Call the Blade<br />
The Essence of the Lawgiver manifests in a gleaming blade of the sun. This blade is always a glowing weapon that inflicts aggravated damage to creatures of darkness and sheds light as bright as a torch. The Exalt can summon this weapon to her hand from anywhere it has fallen, as a diceless, miscellaneous action.<br />
The character defines the form of her weapon upon purchasing this Charm. Statistically, the weapon has traits equal to single or paired basic 1-dot close-range orichalcum artifact weapon (such as a daiklave, grimcleaver, or direlance) of the player’s choice. A 1-dot weapon cost 3m. Paired 1 dot weapons costs 6m. “Brawling aides” such as smashfists are not valid forms.<br />
Players wishing to have multiple options may purchase this Charm multiple times, creating a different weapon with each purchase.<br />
The character gains one mote each action while she is actively wielding <em>Glorious Solar Saber</em>. The character must be in battle to benefit from the one mote drip. She may only benefit from one drip from weaponry at a time. Should the Solar have their own weapon other than that generated from the Charm, they may spend 1m reflexively to invoke this Charm to gain the benefit of the mote drip for their weapon.</p>

The maneuver named Iron Raptor Technique extends the Solar’s reach. Her weapon flies toward the enemy like a hungry bird of prey, then returns at the Solar’s call. This Charm is a Melee-based attack that costs two motes and can attack enemies up to (Essence x 8) yards from the Solar. It is in all other ways treated as a normal Melee attack.<br />
If the Exalt has Essence 3+, she can spend two additional motes for a total cost of four motes and throw a burning arc of energy from her weapon instead of the weapon itself. This is called the “Sandstorm-Wind Attack.” It cannot be blocked without a stunt or Charm.<br />
This Charm inflicts automatic knockdown if it strikes its target. If the character has learned <em>Lightning Strikes Twice</em>, she may activate it as soon as the knockdown occurs, catching her weapon’s hilt as she flows into her second attack.</p>

The Solar’s Caste mark blazes as she casts molten sunlight from her weapon. This Charm is a Melee based attack with a pool of (Dexterity + Melee + Essence), which may stretch out to strike any opponent the Solar is able to directly perceive (maximum range one mile). This attack halves any DV applied against it, and ignores any cover less than 100%. It deals lethal damage with a base damage, before adding attack successes, of (the Exalt’s Strength + Willpower). This damage is aggravated against creatures of darkness.</p>

The maneuver named <em>Dipping Swallow Defense</em> restores defensive advantage to a beleaguered or overextended fighter. This Charm is used in response to an attack. It allows the Exalt to ignore all penalties that apply to her Melee-derived Parry DV when resolving that attack. Her Parry DV is still 0 if it’s inapplicable, but it takes no further penalties.<br />

Like a terrible war machine, the Solar walks through the field of his enemy’s blades and is unmoved.

The Lawgivers have returned into a world of peril and sorrow, a cruel age that threatens to destroy all that they cherish and hold dear. So long as there is a weapon in their hands, they can fight against this dark time, holding it forevermore at bay. As the Solar activates this Charm, he attunes his martial instincts to a single Melee weapon he wields, invoking an aurora of blue and gold flames to surround it with protective Essence. He takes no DV penalties from attacks made with the chosen weapon, and adds +2 to its Defense rating. This only applies to the one weapon so penalties may reduce the character’s Defense bonus from dual wielding weapons, though the penalty may never reduce beyond the bonus Defense from the extra weapons value for internal penalties or half that for external penalties.<br />
The Solar may also use the enchanted weapon to perfectly parry any attack against him in Step 2, even if that attack is unblockable. Doing so ends this Charm prematurely, as the corona of protective Essence flares to supernova brilliance, and then fades away. Once the Solar has done so, he cannot reactivate this Charm for the rest of the scene, a limitation that counts as this defense’s Flaw of Invulnerability. With Melee 5+, Essence 5+, the Solar may invoke this defense up to (Essence ÷ 2) times in one scene before this Charm ends.</p>

Those who attack the Chosen of the Sun invite their own deaths. The Solar invokes this Charm after using her Parry DV against an attack. This Charm gives the Solar a counterattack, which is resolved in Step 9 of the initial attack’s resolution. Note the rules for counterattacks on pages 150 and 183.<br />
If the Lawgiver has stocked any free reflexive attacks, she may expend one such attack part of the cost of this Charm’s activation, along with a +2m surcharge, to make her counterattack unblockable.<br />

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Protection of Celestial Bliss<br />
The Solar Exalted embody a limitless destructive power which is second to none. Using this Charm, the character may tap into that power, focusing it into a large-scale defense capable of striking down and turning aside all incoming forces with an even greater force of her own. Defending herself is not good enough; even if a star should fall, the Exalt may use Guarding Star Tactics to deflect it away from all that she wishes to protect by an unrivaled display of power. This Charm serves as a permanent upgrade to <em>Heavenly Guardian Defense</em>, allowing it to be activated with a four mote surcharge to serve as a perfect parry against any area-of-effect attack, environmental damage effect, or ranged attack from a complementary unit, a parry which destroys or turns aside the offending attack. Players should feel free to invent suitably dramatic stunts to express the way in which attacks are defeated.<br />
Attacks may be divided into two categories: transitory and sustained.<br />
<strong>Transitory</strong>: Transitory attacks are attacks composed of perishable physical matter, energy, or non-permanent environmental hazards. Defending against a transitory attack destroys that effect utterly at the point where it intersects the Lawgiver’s weapon, preventing it from harming anything behind the Solar, or any complementary unit he is a special character in.<br />
For example: The Exalt unleashes an arc of solar flame from his blade, burning away an arrow volley as it descends toward his army. Crackling waves of golden lightning erupt from the Solar’s daiklave, shattering a swarm of obsidian butterflies in midair. The Solar’s weapon strikes an incoming tidal wave, sending a sheet of Essence boiling across it surface and evaporating it before it can smash into Chiaroscuro. The Lawgiver’s sword dissolves the leading edge of a Total Annihilation shockwave, unraveling the spell in moments. The Solar plunges his weapon into the ground, stilling an earthquake with a pulse of Essence.<br />
<strong>Sustained</strong>: Sustained attacks include attacks made of the five magical materials, attacks which are part of the body of a living being, permanent environmental hazards, and environmental hazards or attacks which the Storyteller deems unsuitable to arbitrary destruction. Attacks made with imperishable materials (such as a rain of jade arrows) are simply scattered and deflected without harm. Attacks made by permanent environmental hazards (such as the Pole of Fire) are stilled within (Essence) miles for (Essence) actions. Attacks made by living environmental hazards (such as the winds of Adorjan or a Lunar using a swarm Knack) are prevented from moving to intersect or bypass the position of Solar or any complementary unit he is a member of until their DV has refreshed. Attacks unsuitable for arbitrary destruction are generally one-of-a-kind storyline events, and are deflected or otherwise handled according to the Storyteller’s discretion. Potential examples of resolution of such attacks:<br />
<em>Golden lightning leaps from the Solar’s blade to catch Mount Metagalapa before it can fall on her army, then shifts the mountain so that it is deposited safely on the ground several miles away. A shockwave erupts from the Solar’s blade, knocking the flying manse away without harm moments before it would have crashed into Tzatli. A pillar of sunfire rises from the Lawgiver’s blade, preventing two of Malfeas’s layers from crashing together and sending them slowly drifting apart. A slash releases a cyclone which ironically carries Adorjan away.</em></p>

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Protection of Celestial Bliss<br />
The Solar whirls into a devastating attack, felling all who would stand against her with a storm of slashes. The character makes a standard Melee attack and applies it against all enemies within (Melee x 100) yards. Allies are immune to this onslaught; the waves of lethal radiance dance deftly past them. This attack is also applied against any enemy who moves into the effect radius during the Charm’s duration, and applied again once per tick against any enemy attempting to move toward the Lawgiver. The attack produced by this Charm deals aggravated damage to creatures of darkness.<br />
If used over consecutive actions, the Charm loses its Willpower cost after the first use, and cumulatively lowers its mote cost by two on each subsequent activation, to a minimum cost of 5m. The range of its area of destruction doubles with each consecutive activation. The Charm cannot spread to encompass more than the Solar’s (Essence x 3) miles.<br />
Directed against a complementary unit in mass combat, this Charm renders the attack unblockable and undodgeable, and multiplies its final damage in Step 10 by the Lawgiver’s Essence.</p>

A brilliant red-gold corona erupts around the Lawgiver’s weapon, empowering him to strike down his enemies. This Charm allows the character to enchant a weapon with <em>Fire and Stones Strike</em> for the duration of a scene rather than a single attack, at a cost of three motes per die added, following the same rules for maximum dice. This also counts toward the maximum number of dice that may be purchased with a subsequent normal activation of <em>Fire and Stones Strike</em>. Any nonmagical weapon forced to channel such power is destroyed when the Charm ends.<br />

The Solar’s weapon surges with the limitless power of the wrathful sun god. An attack supplemented by this Charm adds (Essence) dice of raw damage in Step Seven. Should the levels of damage to be rolled after soak in Step Eight exceed the target’s maximum total health levels, the Solar may instead inflict as many or as few levels of damage as desired.<br />
At Essence 6+, with three mote, one Willpower surcharge, this Charm may be used to inflict whatever level of damage the Lawgiver desires to nonmagical objects and structures up to the size of a palace. Cutting passes through hills or smashing down stout fortress gates are trivial exercises for such mighty heroes. At Essence 9+ the character may pay another five-mote surcharge upon activation to inflict as many or as few automatic levels of damage as desired to targets regardless of his total dice in Step Eight, destroying everything but indestructible objects and Artifact N/A.<br />
A second purchase, allows the Solar to activate this Charm as a miscellaneous action (Speed 5, DV –1), and commit Essence to it to “store” it in advance. When the commitment is reflexively dropped (this must be done in Step One), the Charm activates without counting as a Charm use. At Essence 6+, the Solar may store up to (Essence/2) activations simultaneously, though each must have Essence committed to it separately.</p>

The Lawgiver channels the blinding radiance of his anima banner through his blade, empowering it as an icon of his martial legend and heroic triumph. While Immortal Blade Triumphant is active, the Solar’s anima banner emanates from a chosen weapon, not from his person. At the lowest levels of anima flare, this channeling suffuses the enchanted blade with the light and colors of the Lawgiver’s banner; at higher levels, the anima banner emanates from the enchanted blade itself, taking on the shape of the weapon it shines from. This Charm ends if the chosen weapon leaves the Lawgiver’s hands, but his will alone is capable of breaking the bond. The weapon cannot be destroyed or disarmed, nor is it affected by magic that would break the Solar’s attunement to it.<br />
As the vessel of the Solar’s anima and personal legend, the enchanted weapon resonates with his heroic will, adding any dice from stunting or channeled Virtues to damage rolls as well as attack rolls. The overwhelming Essence pressure of the anima surrounding the weapon also magnifies the weapon’s strength, both to lay waste to the Lawgiver’s enemies and to shield him from harm. Any damage rolls made with the weapon convert up to (Essence) dice to automatic successes, and parrying with it adds (Essence) to the Solar’s DV.<br />
Should the Solar have need of power beyond even this, then he may unleash the triumphant power of his martial legend in a single devastating attack. While his anima banner is flaring at the 16m+ level, he may choose to discharge this Charm through an attack. Doing so adds (Essence) automatic success to the damage roll instead of converting dice to successes, and allows the attack to bypass both soak and Hardness. Calling upon this power ends this Charm and resets the Solar’s anima banner to the 0m level.</p>

Capable of mastering all forms of combat, a Solar need not limit herself to a single weapon. This Charm represents the Lawgiver’s mastery of and kinship with all forms of tactile artifact weaponry. When attuning multiple artifact weapons, the Solar commits Essence to the weapon with the highest attunement cost. All additional artifact weapons cost only a single mote to attune. The Solar may attune artifacts up to double the mote cost of the initial attunement. For example, she pays an attunement cost of five motes to attune a daiklave, and may now attune five additional weapons, each for a single mote, provided each weapon has a commitment cost equal to or less than five motes. If she attempts to add a weapon to her array which has a higher commitment cost than the most expensive of her current weapons, the original highest-cost weapon in her current panoply of attuned weapons transfers all but one mote to the new highest-cost weapon and the Solar attunes the new weapon by paying the difference.<br />
The Lawgiver may expressly use this Charm to reduce the attunement cost of artifact weapons for use with combat abilities other than Melee, however it does not reduce the cost to attune armor, N/A-rated artifacts or non-weapon artifacts.<br />
At Essence 4+, once the Solar has attuned enough weapons to double the commitment cost of the highest-cost weapon in her array, all additional artifact weapons have an attunement cost of zero motes. At Essence 5+, the power of her attunement expands further: the Lawgiver may reach the threshold of zero mote attunement after increasing her total commitment by only 50%, rounded up. <em>For example, at Essence 5+ the Solar attunes a daiklave for five motes. The next three weapons she attunes will each cost a single mote, and all weapons beyond that will cost zero motes.</em></p>

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Iron Whirlwind Attack<br />
Turning inward, drawing down, the Cross-Fang Maelstrom is a phantom storm birthed in the heart of the righteous. The character must have at least three stocked free reflexive attacks in order to channel this attack against her target. The Solar expends up to (Dexterity + 3) stored reflexive attacks upon activation, allowing the character to create a flurry consisting of an equal number of Melee attacks against a single opponent. All attacks in this flurry are made at the Solar’s full dice pool, and the flurry has a total DV penalty equal to the highest penalty on any single attack in the flurry. Upon activation, the player decides how many attacks to launch against the target, but may unleash no fewer than three attacks. Treat each of the attacks as if they were the result of a coordinated attack effort (see Exalted, p. 144), with each attack lowering the target’s DV by an equal number. This effect stacks with the successes from coordinating an attack, but only the Exalt’s attacks benefit from the increased target DV reduction caused by this Charm. If the target flees the Solar’s flurry through the use of Charms such as <em>Leaping Dodge Method</em>, the Solar regains a number of free reflexive attacks equal to the number of attacks remaining when the opponent moved out of range.</p>

<strong>Type</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: None<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Iron Whirlwind Attack<br />
The Solar controls the pace of battle and is exhilarated by her enemy’s retreat. Whenever the character forces her opponent to use a movement-based evasion Charm such as <em>Leaping Dodge Method</em> to escape a close-range attack, the Exalt regains one point of Willpower. Characters may not gain more than one Willpower point per action through this Charm’s effect.</p>
<h2 id="toc36"><span>Thousand Arm Prana</span></h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: -(1m); <strong>Mins</strong>: Melee 2, Essence 3;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Stackable<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Summoning the Loyal Steel<br />
Never again shall a Lawgiver suffer being apart from her blades. A character with this Charm may pay one mote to indefinitely store (Essence x 2) weapons Elsewhere, including close- and long-range weapons. This Charm also expressly permits the storage of shields. Thousand Arms Prana is Stackable; the Solar may reflexively store as many weapons as she wishes Elsewhere, at a rate of one mote per (Essence x 2) weapons. In order to retrieve a weapon stored in this manner, the Solar must concentrate on that weapon and pay an additional mote, causing the weapon to fall to the ground at her feet. The character may also use Charms such as Elegant Dance of Bow and Blade to draw her weapons from Elsewhere.<br />
As long as the Solar maintains an Essence commitment to this Charm, she may sheath weapons in Elsewhere without cost, up to her storage limit. Releasing the motes committed to storing her weapons in Elsewhere causes them to fall to the ground around the character in a circle ([Essence x 2] x [number of committed motes released]) yards in diameter. Her weapons do not become immediately tangible, but rather they glow with ghostly blue-white flames, and though they appear to be embedded all throughout the scenery, they can neither be grasped nor moved by anyone but the Lawgiver for one hour, after which the flames disperse and the weaponry rejoins existence. Should she commit motes back to Thousand Arms Prana before the hour’s end, she may instantly banish her emblazoned weaponry with a thought if she so chooses, or may otherwise place new weaponry into Elsewhere for the duration of this commitment. If the Solar grasps an emblazoned weapon at any point before the hour ends, the weapon immediately re-enters existence and becomes tangible to characters other than the Solar. Should a Lawgiver die while using this Charm, her weapons do not spring from Elsewhere, but rather float through the pocket-space of not-here, individual weapons falling into Creation and other realms of existence across (Essence) months from the character’s death.<br />
Finally, purchasing this Charm grants the Solar an experience point refund for the cost of its prerequisite.</p>
<h2 id="toc37"><span>Sun-Sword Concentration</span></h2>

<strong>Type</strong>: Supplemental<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Martial-Ready, Mirror (All Blades Cry for Blood), Obvious<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Instant<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Hungry Tiger Technique<br />
Solar Essence superheats the Lawgiver’s blade until it glows cherry-red, burning hot enough to cleave through solid steel as if it were air. An attack supplemented by this Charm gains the Piercing tag and ignores all Hardness from armor.<br />
With Essence 3+, the Solar can pay an additional mote to ignore Hardness from other sources.<br />
<em>Martial-Ready</em>: Archery, Martial Arts, Thrown</p>
<h2 id="toc38"><span>Molten Sun-Blade</span></h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: -(+3m); <strong>Mins</strong>: Melee 3, Essence 3;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Mirror (Rending Steel Cruelty), Stackable<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Sun-Sword Concentration<br />
This Charm upgrades <em>Sun-Sword Concentration</em>. For an additional three motes, any armor worn by a character damaged by the enhanced attack loses two points from its soak, as the Solar’s molten blade cuts away its strength. Mundane armor is permanently damaged by this Charm unless manually repaired, and is destroyed utterly upon being reduced to zero soak. Excess reduction is lost. Artifact armor regains all lost soak at the end of the scene. Armor soak from Charms only lasts for the duration of the Charm or the end of the scene, allowing ones that grant soak on a per mote basis to free up motes committed to lost soak.</p>
<h2 id="toc39"><span>Edge of Morning Sunlight</span></h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 1m, 1wp; <strong>Mins</strong>: Melee 3, Essence 3;<br />

<strong>Keywords</strong>: Holy, Obvious<br />

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Iron Raptor Technique<br />
With a flash from his blade, the Solar sears a burning image into the mind of his enemy. A character who activates this Charm unleashes a glint of perfect light, caught in the motion of his weapon.<br />
This Charm creates a ranged Melee attack against a single target up to (Essence x 10) yards away. A flash of light, accompanied by a hollow, glassy pop, stuns the victim. This attack is guaranteed to land; it will strike the target with a threshold of at least zero successes. However, <em>Edge of Morning Sunlight</em> does not inflict health level damage. Instead it blinds and dazes the target, inflicting a -1 internal penalty to the target’s combat actions for every health level of damage it would have inflicted. This debilitating condition lasts for (Essence x 2) ticks. When placed in a Combo, any attack which includes <em>Edge of Morning Sunlight</em> inflicts no damage. Finally, <em>Edge of Morning Sunlight</em> is not Stackable, and may only be used against the same target once every five actions.<br />
If used to target a creature of darkness, the Solar adds his Essence to the weapon's Accuracy.</p>
<h2 id="toc40"><span>Corona of Radiance</span></h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: -(+5m, 1wp); <strong>Mins</strong>: Melee 5, Essence 5;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Crippling, Holy, Obvious<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Blazing Solar Bolt, Edge of Morning Sunlight<br />
The holy wrath of an enraged Lawgiver is a thing to behold. Channeling his martial skill into a burning aura of killing force that blazes bright red in his anima, the Solar increases the power of this Charm’s prerequisites. The Solar may pay an additional five motes, one Willpower when using either of those Charms to activate <em>Corona of Radiance</em>. Doing so repeats the damage application (Step 10) of those Charms (Essence + 3) times against a single target. Alternately, the Solar may use this Charm to launch <em>Blazing Solar Bolt</em> or <em>Edge of Morning Sunlight</em> against (Essence + 3) opponents simultaneously (making a different roll against each target).<br />
A repurchase of this Charm allows the Solar to pay a seven mote, one Willpower surcharge to split this attack against (Essence + 3) opponents and resolve damage against each of them (Essence + 3) times. When enhanced by <em>Corona of Radiance</em>, <em>Edge of Morning Sunlight</em> gains the Stackable Keyword.</p>

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Iron Raptor Technique, Peony Blossom Attack<br />
The wind blows, the grass sways; a shadow passes over the sun. In a moment frozen in time, the Solar calls weapon to hand, birthing a gale to silence a legion. <em>Grass-Cutting Strike</em> upgrades the Solar’s <em>Peony Blossom Attack</em>, permitting the character to pay a four mote surcharge to apply its attack to all enemies within (Melee x 8) yards.</p>

The Lawgiver’s skill with a shield may even guard her against a bolt from the blue. When the character uses a shield to respond to ranged attacks from outside her engagement range she gains the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>The attack suffers a -1 external penalty to hit.</li>
<li>All Melee Charms used to block such attacks cost one mote less, to a minimum of 0 motes.</li>
</ul>

The Lawgiver’s skill with a shield may even guard her against a bolt from the blue. When the character uses a shield to respond to ranged attacks from outside her engagement range she gains the following benefits:<br />
The Bronze Tigers stand as a warning to the enemies of Creation: those who sow the wind reap the whirlwind. Any time a character using Final Sunset Stance successfully parries an attack with this DV, she stocks a free reflexive attack which she may withhold or unleash at a moment of her choosing. Unused stocked attacks vanish from the Solar’s arsenal when the scene ends. A Solar may stock no more than (Essence + 3) attacks in this fashion through any combination of any Charms which stock free reflexive attacks, such as <em>Shrike Saving Discretion</em>.<br />

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Final Sunset Stance<br />
In the darkness before the dawn, the Lawgiver is armed in moments; her every breath a promise of tomorrow. The Solar may convert stocked reflexive attacks into motes. The Solar is seen to strike across her center with fist or blade, severing as many attacks as she chooses from her gamut of potential actions. Each attack converted in this manner instantly becomes two motes.</p>
<h2 id="toc45"><span>Dawn's Parable Defense</span></h2>

<strong>Type</strong>: Reflexive (Step 9)<br />

<strong>Duration</strong>: Instant<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Dipping Swallow Defense<br />
Striking a fast blow between the attacker's swings at the perfect moment, the Solar breaks the attacker’s flurry. This Charm is identical to the Lunar Charm <a href="/lunar-reaction#toc2">Furious Unhappy Recourse</a>, but it works with other Solar Counterattack Charms like <em>Ready in Eight Directions Stance</em>.<br />
<em>Martial-Ready</em>: Martial Arts</p>

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: None<br />
Like a diamond that knows its edges, the Solar is aware of all angles which affect the symmetry of perfect form. A Lawgiver with this Charm has honed his defensive skills to a superhuman degree; he knows the limits and reach of his weapons as if they were but extensions of his will. Whenever the Lawgiver uses his Parry DV to avoid a physical attack, he adds a bonus equal to half the attacker’s Essence, rounded up. This bonus counts as dice added by a Charm. Even unenlightened mortals, who have an Essence of 1, apply for this Charm.<br />

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Perfect Blade Aegis<br />
The Solar Exalted are living weapons; as they evolve into this role, they begin to manifest the very threat they pose to their enemies, until no angle of attack seems safe. Attacking a Lawgiver with this Charm is dangerous at best, for her very gestures, mannerisms, and glances carry all the import and possibility of a daiklave’s edge. This Charm imposes a -2 external penalty on all attacks made against the Solar.<br />
<strong>Merged</strong>: Dodge</p>

<strong>Duration</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Blade Lair Discipline<br />
The terrifying battle prowess of the Solar Exalted leads their foes to contemplate extinction. A Solar with this Charm bleeds her unmitigated talent for killing into the air, making her killer’s nature known. The Lawgiver’s attacks render her targets hopeless to defend against them, reducing targeted DVs by two on all attacks the Solar makes with her Melee dice pool.<br />
<em>Martial-Ready</em>: Archery, Martial Arts, Thrown</p>
<h2 id="toc49"><span>Guardian Sunfire Catechism</span></h2>

<strong>Type</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Martial-Ready, Mirror (Entropic Blade Nature), Native<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Heavenly Guardian Defense<br />
A Lawgiver’s skill in combat evolves into an unshakeable truth with all the conviction of a religion. When her resolve is challenged, her holy blade becomes the answer to all her enemy’s questions. This Charm enhances its prerequisite. The Solar may opt to pay a three mote surcharge when activating <em>Heavenly Guardian Defense</em>, extending its duration to One Tick. Solars with Essence 5+ may extend the duration of <em>Heavenly Guardian Defense</em> to Until Next Action by paying a three mote, one Willpower surcharge. The Exalt’s weapon is seen to leave burning golden-orange streaks in the air as it flashes out to meet all attacks. When using this Charm in conjunction with Defend Other, the Solar must activate this Charm multiple times to cover multiple allies, paying the Charm’s activation cost and surcharge separately for each target she wishes to defend for One Tick or Until Next Action. This Charm may not enhance activations of <em>Heavenly Guardian Defense</em> pre-loaded through <em>Protection of Celestial Bliss</em>.</p>
<h2 id="toc50"><span>Blind Impulse Strike</span></h2>

<strong>Keywords</strong>: Counterattack, Martial-Ready<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Instant<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Iron Raptor Technique, Solar Counterattack<br />
Sensing the pulse of Essence along which an attack was fired, a Lawgiver may send a strike back at his opponent with perfect form and blazing speed. This Charm allows the Solar to respond to an attack with a Melee attack of his own. This attack has infinite range, ignores cover, and may be made even if the Solar is unable to see his target. If assailed by a ranged weapon, the source of the attack is rent by a razor-edged heat shimmer of Essence at his location. At Essence 5+ the Solar may use <em>Blind Impulse Strike</em> in response to social attacks he is aware of, so long as they occur within the same realm of existence. At Essence 6+ the Solar may use this Charm to respond to all social attacks, regardless of where the perpetrator is. <em>Blind Impulse Strike</em> may only be activated once in response to a written social attack, no matter how many times the Solar re-reads it.<br />
<em>Martial-Ready</em>: Martial Arts</p>

<strong>Keywords</strong>: Counterattack, Martial-Ready<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Instant<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Ready in Eight Directions Stance<br />
In every battle there is a perfect moment to strike; in the stillness of inaction-becoming-action, a fight may be decided by a mere speck in time: a choice to move or not move. The Solar knows these moments like brothers and summons them to hand like hawks, making all her choices perfect. Until her next action, a character under the effects of <em>Flawless Mirror Trance</em> gains the following benefits: she adds her Essence to her Melee-derived Parry DV; whenever she uses her Melee-derived Parry DV against an attack, she may make a Melee-based counterattack with (Essence) dice added to her regular attack pool in step 9; and she may use her Melee-based parry DV to parry unblockable attacks.<br />

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: None<br />
The heroes of the dawn are in tune with the Essence of the world. The Exalt invokes this Charm in response to an unexpected attack. The attack is no longer unexpected to their Parry DV, can use applicable Charms, and the Exalt may draw their weapon in a flash to parry the blow. For an extra mote, this Charm may be reflexively activated to Defend Other retroactively even if the Solar doesn't have the action prepared, so long as the character would have been able to perform such an action normally.<br />
