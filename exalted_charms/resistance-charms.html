<h2 id="toc1"><span>Whirlwind Armor-Donning Prana</span></h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 1m; <strong>Mins</strong>: Resistance 1, Essence 1;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Simple<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Mirror (Armor-Calling Kata)<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Instant<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: None<br />
When the Solar armors himself for battle, there is no delay or fumbling—Essence smoothes his course. This Charm allows the Exalt to make one minute’s progress on donning armor in a single action. The Solar Exalted normally use this Charm for a number of successive actions equal to the armor’s mobility penalty in order to complete the armor-donning process. <em>For example, six actions and six invocations allows an Exalt to gird himself in chain swathing. Facing exigent circumstances such as limited Essence or frequent interruptions, he could also spend two minutes’ effort and four invocations of the Charm.</em><br />
This Charm applies to personal worn items, including body armor, shields, clothing, and warstriders.</p>

Armor worn in countless battles becomes a part of the Solar’s spirit. It is always on hand when its master calls. The Solar first dons a suit of armor that she owns and has worn in battle. This Charm banishes that armor to Elsewhere. The Solar can gird herself in that armor directly from Elsewhere. Doing so takes as much time as donning the armor normally would, and she can use <em>Whirlwind Armor-Donning Prana</em> to speed the process. The Charm ends when she does so. If she cancels the Essence committed to this Charm while the armor is fully or partially Elsewhere, any donned pieces return Elsewhere, and then, the entire suit appears within arm’s reach.<br />
This Charm applies to body armor and shields, but not other worn items.</p>

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Whirlwind Armor-Donning Prana<br />
The Solar armors himself in the blazing glory of the Unconquered Sun. Glowing golden armor manifests on his body as he activates this Charm, taking on a form chosen by the Solar at the time he purchases the Charm. Statistically, the armor has traits equivalent to those of any basic orichalcum artifact armor with a rating of 3 dots or lower. One-dot armors cost 3m, 1wp to invoke with this Charm.<br />
Regardless of their design or statistics, the armors created by this Charm shine with golden light equivalent to an 8-10m anima display. Creatures of darkness are staggered by this radiance, subtracting the Solar’s Essence from the raw damage of their attacks against him, to a minimum of one. Should the Solar have their own armor other than that generated from the Charm, they may spend 1m reflexively to invoke this Charm to gain the benefit of the shining radiance for their armor.<br />
For a two-mote surcharge, this armor may be invoked along with an Essence-forged shield decorated with either the symbol of the Unconquered Sun or a depiction of the character’s iconic anima. This shield has the traits of a mundane shield of the character’s choice, again chosen at the time of Charm purchase.<br />
Players wishing to have multiple options may take this Charm multiple times, defining a different suit of armor each time they purchase it.</p>

In these grim and degenerate times, the Chosen of the Sun must be as soldiers ready for a battle. They cannot relax in the face of their enemies, and must sometimes wear armor for days at a time. Yet, they do not weary. For every mote spent, this Charm reduces both the fatigue value and the mobility penalty of the Solar’s armor by one, to a minimum of 0. A fatigue value of 0 means that the Solar’s player need never roll to see whether her character becomes fatigued from wearing the armor. This Charm lasts until the character removes the armor in question.<br />
This Charm applies to any combination of worn items that give a mobility or fatigue penalty. This includes body armor, shields, combinations of body armor and shields, warstriders and articles of clothing that impose mobility or fatigue.</p>

The Lawgivers are armored in righteousness; many need no other hauberk. This Charm upgrades <em>Durability of Oak Meditation</em>. The Solar may pay a surcharge of four motes to increase the soak bonus of the Charm to (Essence + Stamina + Resistance)/2 and extend its duration to one scene. He cannot do so if he is wearing armor; donning armor later immediately ends any upgraded activations of <em>Durability of Oak Meditation</em>.</p>

Driven by her purpose and her Virtues, the Exalt becomes invincible. The Solar invokes this Charm immediately before the damage of a physical attack or similar effect is rolled. This Charm is a perfect defense against the raw and final damage of the attack, reducing it to zero after all other effects. This Charm has one of the Four Flaws of Invulnerability (see p. 194). This Charm does not protect against effects related to touching the Solar, just causing damage to him.<br />
As a point of clarification, damage added to an attack after soak is applied, such as by <em>Fire and Stones Strike</em>, cannot harm a character who activates this Charm.</p>

The more terrible the enemies and adversities they face, the greater the power of a Solar’s spirit. Whenever the Lawgiver is injured, she gains motes pool: one mote for being struck by an attack without taking damage, two motes per point of bashing damage, or three motes per point of lethal or aggravated damage suffered.<br />
<em>Essence-Gathering Temper</em> will only provide motes when the Solar is injured against her will; she may no more order a bound demon to assault her in order to obtain motes than she may gain them from stabbing herself. Health lost in order to pay the activation cost of a Charm likewise never produces motes.<br />
At Essence 3+ the Solar may regain motes when she perceives her allies being injured, at the same rate as though she were taking damage herself. In order to gain motes in this fashion, the Solar must directly perceive the character being injured at the moment the injury occurs, and must have a positive Intimacy toward that individual (the character’s Lunar mate also always qualifies). Finally, the injuries may not be self-inflicted, as outlined above, and may not be inflicted by the Solar herself.</p>

The Lawgiver draws inner strength from the challenges that face him. He invokes this Charm when hit by an attack that damaged him, that is, an attack that cost him at least one health level of damage. His player rolls one die for each health level lost. This Charm restores one point of temporary Willpower for each success rolled, plus one point. This Charm cannot raise the Exalt’s Willpower above its normal value. This Charm cannot work on self-inflicted wounds as outlined in its prerequisite.</p>

The character steels herself for the struggle ahead. She awakens in her soul a deep and terrible passion, stoic dedication, primal rage, merciless justice or some other emotion appropriate to her nature, and lets it drive her into battle. This Charm gives the character a bonus die to all combat-related pools and reduces all wound penalties by one.<br />
The character must be engaged in combat or attempting to become so engaged. She can attack at range and differentiate friend from foe, but she cannot utter sentences of more than a few words, move away from the enemy or perform complex actions such as retrieving a small object from a pack.</p>

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Battle Fury Focus<br />
When ordinary means have failed, and there is nothing left save life and death, then it befits the god-kings of legend to give themselves over to the battle-trance and make themselves implacable enemies to their foes. By paying a 2m surcharge when activating <em>Battle Focus Fury</em>, it upgrades its effects. It instead gives the character three extra dice to all combat-related pools and removes all wound penalties. The character’s mind is consumed by the battle-trance. The character cannot speak coherently and cannot retreat. She may only take one or more of the following actions: moving toward her current target by the shortest route, attacking enemies within range, waiting for an attacker to engage her or selecting the nearest enemy as a new target when her previous target is incapacitated, dead or not locatable.<br />
This Charm lasts until the character can no longer locate an enemy to kill. Enemies include known enemies and those who get in her way. Strangers and acquaintances can earn the enemy label if they are dressed like the enemy or if they act in a suspicious fashion. The character will not attack close friends, relatives or lovers for suspicious action or clothing, they must actively interfere to become targets of attack.<br />
To end this Charm prematurely, the Solar must spend one Willpower. Reduce this to no Willpower if a loved one or friend attempts to restrain the character. Unfortunately, if the Exalt does not end the Charm when one attempts to break her battle-trance, she is almost certain to lash out at the unrecognizable blur distracting her from slaying her target.</p>

A player may purchase this Charm up to once per dot of the Resistance Ability her character possesses. Each purchase provides one of the following, at the player’s option, determined at the time of purchase:</p>
<ul>
<li>One -0 health level</li>

<li>One -1 health level and two -2 health levels</li>

Not easily are the Lawgivers slain. This Charm stops Poison and Sickness from doing further damage to the character for one scene and cures any on going ones. This Charm also prevents the character from suffering new Poison or Sickness effects during this scene. Effects that would poison or sicken him have no effect whatsoever. The character can walk hand-in-hand with plague victims, sprinkle poison on his food and eat ichneumon eggs as caviar. There are never ill effects later from these indiscretions.</p>

Success speeds his healing rate by a factor of 10 per success on the activation roll or, if the character prefers, adds directly to the successes of a physician using <em>Wound-Mending Care Technique</em> or similar Charms on the character.

A repurchase of this Charm makes the Solar immune to aging and his body always in the prime of its life, perfectly protecting against and unmaking any Shaping that would cause him to be otherwise.</p>

Perfection is the nature of the Solar Exalted, and the best efforts of the world cannot draw them away from that state for long. The Solar’s Essence surges and begins to catalyze, producing a crackling, charged feeling in the air around her, as though a storm were about to commence. Once her DV has refreshed five times, she erupts into a torrent of blue-white Essence, shining like a newborn star. When this surge of power passes, the Solar stands unmarred—all her health restored. Activating a Charm with a Flaw of Invulnerability at any point during the Charm’s ‘charging’ period resets its countdown. For example, if a Solar used <em>Rising Sun Renewal</em>, had her DV refresh three times, and then activated <em>Heavenly Guardian Defense</em>, she would need to wait until her DV refreshed five more times before her health levels would be restored. Losing more health levels than the Lawgiver’s Stamina during the course of a single action delays the countdown by one DV refresh.<br />
At Essence 5+, this Charm will also remove all Crippling effects in addition to healing the character.</p>

The Solar’s defense must hold at all costs. If the Solar falls, so does all that she holds dear. From this grim resolution a Solar draws the power to survive all onslaught. The character may use this Charm in response to an attack that incurs raw damage before reductions. Upon activation, his Hardness to rises to a level equal to the raw damage of the attack. This does not prevent damage dice from being rolled, but rather guarantees that all lesser attacks are turned harmlessly aside. The Solar’s Hardness remains at this level for three actions, or until he is struck by an attack that overcomes his Hardness. Should the Solar suffer such an attack, he may reflexively pay five motes to drive his Hardness up to match the attack’s raw damage. This does not count as a Charm activation. This renewed defense will last for three actions or until it is dispelled by a greater attack, whichever comes first. This Charm is ineffective against attacks the Solar permitted to be inflicted upon himself.</p>

Considerate of others, a Solar may choose not to flaunt his invincibility until the very last instant. This Charm is a perfect defense, having one of the Four Flaws of Invulnerability (see <strong>Exalted</strong>, p. 194). Upon activation, reduce the final damage inflicted by an attack to zero. Those crippled by iniquity are not availed of perfection. Characters with two or more points of Limit experience a failure in this defense: final damage is reduced to a number equal to the Solar’s (Limit ÷ 2, round down), as a crack in the Solar’s aegis allows damage to slip through. Under this condition, <em>Ruin-Abasing Shrug</em> loses its Flaw of Invulnerability.<br />
A repurchase at Essence 6 allows the Lawgiver to extend this Charm’s duration to One Tick by paying ten motes upon activation, or to One Action by paying ten motes, one Willpower.<br />
The reason that damage can slip through this defense is due to the Great Curse. Should the Solar overcome the Great Curse, they are no longer subject to its Limit based weakness in their defense.</p>

Essence permeates every fiber of the Solar’s being. Lawgivers with this Charm have learned to focus that Essence upon their vital centers, imbuing their very cells with limitless energy. Whenever a Solar with this Charm heals damaged health levels, she recovers two motes per level. After ten motes have been restored in this fashion in the course of a scene, the Solar only gains one mote per health level healed. When twenty more motes have been paid out in this manner within the same scene, the Solar only gains one mote per two health levels restored. This healing may only occur as a result of rest or of Solar Charms which heal damage. Though this Charm is permanent, it is perpetuated and substantiated by regular meditation upon inner forces turning outward. It is a sacred power which relies upon the Lawgiver’s utmost care for her own well-being. This power fails the Solar if she inflicts harm upon herself or allows others to harm her: injuries from attacks thrown without killing intent will not yield motes when healed.</p>

Undertaking a grueling regimen of endurance training, the Solar folds Essence into his body until his skin becomes hard enough to turn aside blades. The Lawgiver’s natural lethal and bashing soak calculations become (Stamina + 1). This Charm may be purchased up to a total of (Resistance) times; each purchase after the first adds 1 to the character’s natural lethal and bashing soak. This has no downsides for the Solar; he can let a needle pass through his skin as easily as before if he wishes.<br />

Sealed for fifteen centuries in a cage of jade, the Lawgiver reborn has known death and darkness. Never again shall she yield. The player of a character with this Charm may pay one Willpower and Valor channel to roll (Valor) dice, healing a number of health levels equal to the successes on the roll.<br />
Moreover, the resilience of the Solar Exalted is only equaled by their courage; a Lawgiver using this Charm reverses even the most grievous of wounds, canceling them out by denying their existence through force of will. Characters who wish to substitute another Virtue for the purposes of this Charm (roll and channel cost) may do so if dramatically appropriate. This Charm may not be used to heal damage from self-inflicted wounds, including damage incurred as part of the activation cost of a Charm. A character may not use Soul Fire Resurgence more than once per action. This Charm’s Virtue roll may not be enhanced by other Charms or magic; Virtues enhanced by Epic Zeal of (Virtue) are applicable for this Charm’s effects.</p>

Until the day he dies, the Solar will not stop fighting. He will sell his final light dearly. The Solar gains motes each time the Solar’s wound penalty increases. Add a number of motes equal to twice the wound penalty’s value to the Solar’s mote pool. In addition, if the Solar has a wound penalty of -2, reduce the cost of all offensive Charms paid by one mote. This may reduce the activation cost of a Charm to zero motes, but the Solar may only enhance a single attack per tick with Charms costing zero motes. He may continue to benefit from the price reduction across additional attacks on a single tick, but consecutive attacks may not drop the cost of Charms below one mote. If the Solar’s wound penalty is -4 or higher, reduce the cost of offensive Charms paid by three motes. At -4 or higher, the Solar may enhance two attacks per tick with Charms costing zero motes to activate.</p>

This need not be paid all at once, as the motes are put aside until the cost is paid. The Solar may choose to accept the put aside motes if he wishes, but once accepted they cannot be used for the exchange. Only motes gained from Charm are applicable for this exchange, all other sources do not work.</p>

Like the sun they emulate, the Solar Exalted draw unlimited power by their very existence. Whenever he would gain motes from a Charm, he may choose to instead convert them into attunement motes. These special motes are not added to the Solar’s Essence pools, but can be committed to any unattuned artifact he has on his person, allowing him to reflexively attune to it if its cost is paid in full with attunement motes. Alternatively, he can commit attunement motes to an attuned artifact he possesses, replacing the motes he has committed to it from his own pools, freeing the motes to be spent on better things. These freed motes are uncommitted and not spent in the process of freeing them. At the end of the scene, all attunement motes are lost. The Solar may reflexively replace them with his own motes to sustain the attunement of artifacts empowered by them. Only motes gained from Charms can become attunement motes and once converted, cannot be converted back.</p>

After that, he suffers one level of unsoakable bashing damage per day without sleep, which he must heal through rest before he can activate the Charm again.<br />
At Essence 4+, the Solar does away with the limit to how many days he must go, making the Charm an Instant duration instead.<br />
At Essence 6+ this Charm instead becomes a Permanent upgrade to the Solars’ being which requires no motes to use, though the Solar may sleep if he wishes. The Solar is immune to anything forcing him to sleep outside his own volition.</p>

If the Solar ever breaks the Essence commitment, the warstrider will instantly reappear in the nearest space big enough to hold it. This Charm cannot be used to summon a warstrider if the pilot is in a place too small for the artifact to ﬁt. This Charm is often comboed with <em>Hauberk-Lightening Gesture</em> and similar Charms that can banish weapons and armor to Elsewhere so that the Solar can freely switch between warstrider combat and conventional hand-to-hand combat (assuming, of course, that the Solar has prodigious quantities of Essence at his disposal).</p>

Solars are the heroes of legends, and their body is as difficult to wound as the legends they carve into fate. This Charm allows a Solar to spend 3 motes after damage is rolled, but before it is applied, to reduce the damage type a degree. This causes aggravated damage to become lethal, lethal to become bashing, and Bashing to be reduced by half rounding down. Excess damage still spills over into the next type as normal.<br />
As a permanent upgrade to the Solar's nature this Charm also makes it impossible for a Solar to be incapacitated by wound penalties until an Incapacitated health box is ticked with lethal damage, instead they suffer a -4 wound penalty from having bashing in an Incapacitated box. Powers designed to knock out targets bypass this effect.</p>

It is said that a red setting sun is a sign of good fortune, the Chosen of the Sun embrace this saying and turn this into fact. Channeling the red Essence of the setting Sun, the Solar’s body becomes more resistant to damage, allowing them to continue on in the face of mortal slaying wounds. This Charm permanently enhances the Solar’s body forever causing lethal damage to spill over into aggravated as bashing does to lethal. It also enhances the prerequisite Charm, allowing the Solar to remain functioning even with a full track of lethal damage, instead they suffer a -4 wound penalty from having lethal in an Incapacitated box, and will not be knocked incapacitated until they have an Incapacitated box filled with aggravated damage. Powers designed to knock out targets bypass this effect.<br />
As a side effect, when the Solar’s anima banner is flaring and their health track is full of Lethal or more damage, the Solar’s anima turns a blood red color from which this Charm gets its name.</p>

<p><strong>Cost</strong>: —; <strong>Mins</strong>: Resistance 5, Essence 3;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: None<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Blood Red Sunset, Bloodthirsty Sword-Dancer Spirit<br />
Right before the sun dips below the horizon, it is said that a green flash of light appears when powerful being attempts to accept the thralls of death. Utilizing this, the Solar chooses to enter a state of superhuman calm knowing that his life is about to be snuffed out. His body begins to respire essence rapidly as he approaches his breaking point; his will turns to pure survival. The character roars out with a ferocity that only (some) Primordials have seen and survived.<br />
While his health track is filled with at least lethal damage, the character gains (Essence) bonus dots of Strength, Dexterity, and Stamina. In this state the character is borderline mindless, ignoring all Compulsions, Emotional effects, and Servitude effects. No combination of Charms that includes <em>Green Flash Sunset Stance</em> can increase the character’s Physical Attributes by more than his Essence, and this bonus is treated as a dice bonus from Charms.<br />
Additionally, the character gains one point of Limit per DV refresh from the stress and one mote per tick, taking the form of green flashes of light in his blood red anima. Should a character be under Limit Break or enter it during combat they suffer from Berserk Anger flaw under partial control instead of their normal Limit Break curse. Once the character is safe, they end their Limit Break and this Charm’s effects end. While Limit Breaking, they do not gain Limit from this Charm.<br />
This state may be only be entered once per story unless the character spends a permanent Willpower to re-enter it, assuming they still meet the qualifications and decide to use it. As a point of clarification, a character that is free of the Great Curse no longer gains Limit from this Charm.</p>

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Iron Kettle Body<br />

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Tireless Sentinel Technique<br />
The body of the Solar replicates the divine body of the gods. He no longer needs to breathe and may exist entirely off the Essence of the world. Spending one mote gives him the equivalent of one day's worth of food and water. He may still enjoy such pleasures if he desires.</p>
