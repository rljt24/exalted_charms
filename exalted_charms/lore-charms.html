The presence of the Lawgivers wards away chaos. This Charm surrounds the character with a mystic pattern of Essence, what the Fair Folk call an “island of Creation” or a “dead waypoint.” The character’s immediate vicinity, out to (her Essence) in yards, functions according to the laws of Creation, even if the character is in the Wyld, Malfeas, Underworld, or some stranger location.</p>

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Chaos-Repelling Pattern<br />
As masters of the Old Realm, the Solar Exalted used the <em>Wyld-Shaping Technique</em> to conquer chaos and expand Creation. They stood at the edge of the world and forced shape into the teeth of the howling storm. This Charm forces a region of the Wyld to take form as the Exalt commands.<br />
<em>Wyld-Shaping Technique</em> is an extended dramatic action. The dice pool used equals (the Solar’s Intelligence + Lore). Each roll requires five hours of effort, and the character pays the Charm’s cost with each roll. This roll has a base difficulty of 1 in regions of Pure Chaos, 3 in the Deep Wyld, 5 in the Middlemarches, and 7 in the Bordermarches of the Wyld.<br />
When the Lawgiver has accumulated a sufficient number of successes, she must spend them all at once, ending the Charm. Unspent successes are wasted. Successes may be spent in the following manner:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Land</strong>: The primary purpose of <em>Wyld-Shaping Technique</em> is to expand the borders of Creation. A single use of <em>Wyld-Shaping Technique</em> will restructure one waypoint within the Wyld, creating a new landscape roughly 30 miles in diameter. The quality of the created land depends on the number of successes spent. One success will create a near-worthless land: blasted heath, barren desert, lifeless ocean. Three successes permit the creation of useful land: arable farmland, swampland with some herbal resources, desert with sufficient water to support settlement and some mineral resources, forests stocked with game. Five successes create valuable land: ideal farmland, forests full of valuable wood, hills or mountains thick with rich mineral veins, oceans teeming with fish or rare coral beds.
<ul>
<li>Five-success landscapes contain veins of jade. Orichalcum and moonsilver never occur naturally in Wyld-Shaped lands, but gold and silver suitable for refinement into magical materials are a possibility. <em>Wyld-Shaping Technique</em> may not create landscapes containing soulsteel or starmetal. With even higher successes, sometimes rarer lesser magical materials can appear. At ten successes the land has a deposit of ultra rare adamant.</li>
<li>By adding one additional success, the Solar may prepare a created landscape for basic habitation. Depending on the landscape in question, this may mean a collection of sturdy but humble cottages, a fully-furnished and uninhabited town, or a sprawling farmstead complete with barn, corrals, and tools, ready to begin working the land. More ambitious accommodations require construction and improvement by imported residents.</li>
<li>Landscapes made with <em>Wyld-Shaping Technique</em> must be congruent with their surroundings if created within the Bordermarches, Middlemarches, or Deep Wyld. Within the East, for example, a Solar would need to create heavily wooded or vegetation-rich lands; he could not march deep into the Eastern forests and create thirty miles of sandy desert. This does not preclude the possibility of incongruous landscapes, it simply means that the Solars must use previous iterations of <em>Wyld-Shaping Technique</em> to gradually shift the landscape toward something that will accept his desired topography. For example, young Solars in the First Age often forged high mountains ranges in the North with Wyld-Shaping Technique as a prelude to creating deep, sheltered valleys in which they could shape wondrous and fertile gardens. This restriction vanishes in Pure Chaos, where the Solar may create whatever he likes, but the created land will still be subject to the powerful emanations of the nearby Elemental Pole, unless the Solar possesses other stabilizing measures, he should not expect his arid far-Eastern desert to remain barren for very long.</li>
<li><em>Wyld-Shaping Technique</em> may not be used to produce shadowlands.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>People</strong>: The Solar may create useful Essence 1 mortals whole-cloth from the Wyld, generating Magnitude (successes) individuals. An additional success per each increase in Magnitude converts the group into heroic mortals, the previous steps must be heroic mortals before the next can be affected. For example, Magnitude 3 created mortals would need to spend three successes to make Magnitude 2 heroic mortals; one for 0, another for 0 to 1, one for 1 to 2. The Solar couldn't go from 0 to 3 without upgrade the previous steps. Created mortals may not possess any mutations; exotic modifications are the province of training Charms or Craft (Genesis). The Solar defines the mortal’s Motivation, their Attribute priority, and gives them their native language, which the Solar must know how to speak. They possess no Abilities.</li>
<li>Individuals created with <em>Wyld-Shaping Technique</em> are not subject to withering away when out of contact with things of Creation, but are not fully integrated into Creation’s cycles of life and death, either. Their soul is an artificial thing forged of compressed and calcified chaos, and will attempt to return to that state upon death, they cannot leave behind a ghost or reincarnate unless Heaven takes steps to specifically incorporate the individual into the cycle of reincarnation. Wyld-Shaped heroic individuals are potentially eligible for Exaltation, although the Solars of the Old Realm were never able to confirm or debunk this fact to their satisfaction. Exaltation immediately completes the soul of a Wyld-Shaped hero, ensuring that it will continue on beyond death as normal.</li>
<li><strong>Exotic Wonders</strong>: Three to five successes will permit the Solar to create a unique wonder. These items are rarely useful in and of themselves, but are invaluable as components for artifact crafting, and Wyld-Shaping Technique enables Solars to create wonders that could be obtained in no other way. The number of successes required to create a wonder is set at the Storyteller’s discretion, based on the impossibility of the object. Frozen lightning, colorless flame, singing shells and flowers in hues the eye cannot see are all examples of three-success prodigies. Five successes tend to produce the intangible-made-tangible. Five successes will produce happiness captured in a small lacquered box, the scent of sorrow, or a harlot’s lost innocence, all delivered in a form suitable for artifact crafting. This Charm cannot recreate anything the Solar can obtained only by unique means; essentially, some artifacts require “a (specific) impossible wonder” as an exotic component. If a Solar needs a behemoth’s bones to forge an artifact, he must de-bone a behemoth. If he needs the blood of a Dragon-Blooded general, he must go looking for a Dragon-Blooded general.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth</strong>: The Solar may create wealth by expending two successes per Resources dot of treasure desired. This is always created in a non-useful form, cowrie shells, mounds of silver or gold, or heaping mounds of jewels are all examples of wealth that might be produced. This function will not create a jeweled dagger, unless it is of sufficiently poor make to be unsuitable for use as a weapon, nor will it ever create jade currency.</li>
<li><strong>Crafting</strong>: The Solar may will into creation various objects by crystallizing the Wyld into the desired shape. The Solar must still possess the necessary Abilities to craft the object, but uses the Wyld to generate the materials and resources needed to create the objects, shaping them with his will alone. This Charm subverts the typical crafting roll, but may explicitly be Comboed with appropriate Craft Charms, except for effects that speed up the process of building, such as <em>Craftsman Needs No Tools</em>. Crafting in this way doesn't require a workshop, tools, or mundane resources.
<ul>
<li>Mundane objects requires the Solar to have the blueprints on hand or make a relevant Crafts roll to create them while making the object. A object costs (Resources - 1) successes to create Magnitude 0 or increase the Magnitude by 1; their quality doesn't influence the cost. All the objects are identical, or at least similar enough to have the same traits. This can be done on every mundane crafting, from knives and armor to streets and buildings. The objects are built and created where the Solar wishes, meaning he'd likely need a high vantage point to create a city.</li>
<li>Creating artifacts is a more time consuming process, requiring the Solar to hand carve the Essence pathways that power the object. He must have already have the blueprints for the object, which is half the cumulative successes needed, and be able to make the artifact himself. If he doesn't have this, this Charm is of no use, for it only aids him in manufacturing the object, not designing it. Every success spent adds one to the roll crafting the object. When crafting in such a way, the Solar doesn't need any exotic ingredients other than the magical materials; he makes the artifact's Essence paths by designing them directly, not through coaxing them via the appropriate ingredients. Should the Solar stop mid crafting and return to more conventional crafting methods, assume he removed one necessary exotic ingredient every (half the cumulative successes needed / exotic ingredients needed other than magical material) successes, rounded up.</li>
<li>Raising a manse is similarly as hard as an artifact and requires the Solar to have the blue prints for the manse, else he doesn't know what to build. Each success spent counts as 100 mortal workers having worked for a year. This doesn't provide any necessary magical material and automatically caps the demesne unless the Solar doesn't wish to, but otherwise requires no other Resources to accomplish.</li>
<li>The Solar may craft the flesh of beings if he possesses Craft (Flesh). He must make the appropriate roll to design how they wish to give or remove the mutation. Once this is done he may spend successes from <em>Wyld-Shaping Technique</em> to grant or remove it with a success cost equal to the mutation point cost. These mutations are Shaped into the target's being and not a result of the Wyld, but also do not breed with them. The same may be done for physical Crippling effects, such as lost limbs for a cost based on the severity of the effect. A lost finger would be a single success, while a whole limb would be three. Every (mutation cost) successes increases the Magnitude of crafted individuals by 1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Land, exotic wonders, and wealth created with <em>Wyld-Shaping Technique</em> are not quite fully real in and of themselves. Their reality stems from Creation—from the reality of the Lawgivers, the Imperial Mountain, and the Loom of Fate. As long as the created things continue to interact with things of Creation, as through the magical trade networks established in the Old Realm to tame the Wyld, they survive. If something created by this Charm fails to interact extensively with the things of Creation during a story, it begins to lose its reality. Roll its creator’s Essence against either difficulty 1, or, if the Solar’s creation does not interact with reality at all during the story, difficulty 2. After three consecutive failures during which the creation does not interact with things of reality extensively, wonders and wealth cease to exist. Land becomes a Wyld-infected zone of the severity it held before being Wyld-Shaped. Exotic wonders forged into artifacts are always considered to be interacting with reality by virtue of being integrated into an artifact.<br />
Individuals created with this are not subject to withering away when out of contact with things of Creation, but are not fully integrated into Creation’s cycles of life and death, either. Their soul is an artificial thing forged of compressed and calcified chaos, and will attempt to return to that state upon death—they cannot leave behind a ghost or reincarnate unless Heaven takes steps to specifically incorporate the individual into the cycle of reincarnation. Wyld-Shaped heroic individuals are potentially eligible for Exaltation, although the Solars of the Old Realm were never able to confirm or debunk this fact to their satisfaction. Exaltation immediately completes the soul of a Wyld-Shaped hero, ensuring that it will continue on beyond death as normal.<br />
Raksha who find themselves within Wyld-Shaped landscape which has not interacted with any Creation-born for one season and which currently contains no Creation-born may launch a Shaping attack against the landscape as though it were a waypoint. Success will cause the landscape to automatically fail its next stability roll. Activating <em>Wyld-Shaping Technique</em> sends enormous ripples out through the local Wyld, automatically alerting all Fair Folk within five journeys that the Charm is being used, and where.</p>

This Charm enhances the character’s <em>Wyld-Shaping Technique</em>, expanding the palette of things he may create:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demesnes</strong>: To forge a demesne, the Solar must first accumulate successes sufficient to create the land it will occupy. He must then spend one success per desired dot rating of the demesne, up to level-3. The fourth and fifth dots of a demesne’s rating cost two successes each. By default, this will create a demesne appropriate to the landscape, always an elemental demesne. Solars may spend an extra success to create a Solar-aspected demesne, but only if the underlying landscape is a five-success landscape. Alternately, two extra successes may be added to produce Sidereal or Lunar-aspected demesnes, but only in landscapes worth three or more successes.</li>
<li><strong>Land/Wealth</strong>: The Solar may create real land and wealth with <em>Wyld-Shaping Technique</em>, not subject to withering when out of contact with reality.</li>
<li><strong>People</strong>: People created by this possess real, true souls. They are still considered outside of fate until brought in. The solar may turn a crystal soul into a real soul for Magnitude (successes) people using this Charm.</li>
<li><strong>Wyld Mutation</strong>: The Solar may directly manipulate the energy of the Wyld to mutate a being in a way they desire. He can grant any mutation the the Wyld could grant, which the Storyteller decides as appropriate or not, and costs a number successes equal to the mutation cost. These mutations are caused by the Wyld and turn the target into a Wyld mutant, possibly barring them from entering Creation. Every (mutation cost) successes increases the Magnitude of crafted individuals by 1.</li>

The intricate Essence flows of the anima are as a child’s toys to the savants of the Sun. This Charm allows the Solar to give up to five motes to another character. The Solar loses exactly as many motes as the target gains, in addition to the cost of this Charm, but this transfer does not count as spending motes for the purposes of anima banner flare. Transferred motes go first to the target’s personal and then to the target’s peripheral Essence but cannot increase either the target’s personal or the target’s peripheral Essence past their normal maximums. No character can receive more than five motes on a single action from any combination of effects that voluntarily transfer Essence between characters.</p>

Solar loremasters understand the subtle and delicate patterns of Essence that give rise to free will and the self. This Charm strengthens those patterns, reinforcing the target’s determination and certainty. This Charm allows the character to give up to (her Essence) in Willpower to the target. The Solar loses exactly as much Willpower as the target gains, in but this does not count against the normal limits on Willpower expenditure. This Charm cannot increase the target’s Willpower past its normal maximum.</p>

The Lawgivers share great secrets with their disciples. This Charm targets an Essence 1 character who cannot channel Essence. This Charm awakens the target’s effective Essence to 1, allows him a (initially full) 10-mote pool and the ability to regain Essence as a Solar Exalt, and it permits him to use and learn Solar Charms with the normal training time and experience points. The target has access to this increased Essence, mote pool, and Charms only when actively under the influence of <em>Power-Awarding Prana</em> (i.e., for only as long as the awarding Solar’s Essence motes remain committed). This doesn't allow them to learn Native Charms or any Charms beyond his station, such as Celestial or Solar Circle Sorcery, Sidereal Martial Arts, or Celestial Martial Arts except Solar Hero Style. When the Charm ends, the character is instantly refunded the experience spent on Charms. When reapplied to them, they may instantly relearn the Charms they knew as a Training effect.<br />
As an alternative this Charm may perform a ritual called Soul-Enlightening Beneficence. This variation on the better known <em>Power-Awarding Prana</em> immediately and permanently blasts open a willing mortal’s doors of perception, opening him to the world’s currents of Essence. Soul-Enlightening Beneficence requires a short ceremony to steel both donor and recipient for the awesome forces they shall unleash. The ceremony takes whatever form the participants feel is appropriate to solemnize the event. Then the mortal and the Exalt simply touch, and the cataract of Essence flooding through the recipient’s soul knocks him out for (5 – his Stamina) hours. After the character recovers, however, he possesses his own Essence pool (Essence x 10 motes), and now count as an rating 1 Essence user. He may increase his motes and learn Charms as he is an Enlightened Mortal.<br />
This Charm offers no benefit to beings who already channel Essence.<br />
All types of Celestial (and Abyssal and Infernal) Exalts possess a variation of Soul-Enlightening Beneficence. The recipient gains an affinity for the source of the Exalt’s power, like that granted by Touch of Divinity, which other Essence-sensing creatures can perceive.</p>

The Lawgivers restore the hidden patterns of the soul. This Charm targets an individual, whom the Solar must touch. The Lawgiver spends 15 motes and a Willpower. This Charm shatters all Shaping effects on the target, including long-term or permanent effects such as Wyld mutations and Sidereal astrology. The target is immune to further Shaping effects for the remainder of the scene.<br />
Using this Charm outside the Wyld on one of the Fair Folk destroys the target. The dream-wrought bodies of the Fair Folk are a Shaping effect, and this Charm renders them into statues, dreams, objects, animals or ordinary humans at the Storyteller’s discretion.</p>

The Solar draws strength from the harmonious governance of Creation. The greater the social structure he commands, the more Essence he may wield. This Charm allows the Solar to recover motes by tending to the affairs of a kingdom, organization or social or military unit he leads.

In addition, each purchase of this Charm increases the character’s Peripheral Essence pool by 10 motes.<br />

By speaking to the soul of an artifact, a Solar may remind a broken wonder of its legendary purpose, briefly restoring it to working order. Channeling Essence through her sagacious knowledge, the Solar is able to revive a legendary wonder and temporarily restore it to functionality. The Solar may restore a broken or damaged artifact to full working order so long as Essence is committed to sustain this Charm. In order to use this Charm, the Solar must know what the artifact in question is and what it does.</p>

The Solar’s Harmonious Academic Methodology is permanently enhanced by her greater enlightenment. The Solar may now use her instruction to enlighten mortals, granting them Enlightened Essence with a mote pool of (Essence x 10) and an Essence of 1. Only the first third of the pool is accessible without spending a Willpower. They may also raise their Essence with experience as normal. She also abolishes the training cap from <em>Harmonious Academic Methodology</em> and <em>Legendary Scholar Curriculum</em>; only the training cap of her students limits their potential to absorb knowledge at the Solar’s feet. She may also use <em>Harmonious Academic Methodology</em> to impart knowledge of thaumaturgy, sorcerous initiation Charms, or spells, assuming her students are capable of using such magic. She may also train them to increase their Essence rating, up to its normal maximum for their age, doing so take four consecutive uses of its prerequisite to achieve a one dot increase.</p>

The concepts which engender the universe fall readily into the grasp of the Solar Exalted. Emptying himself of all thought and desire, the Lawgiver becomes a vessel for the knowledge of the shinma. Entering a trance state, his eyes become unblinking lanterns and his caste mark appears, glowing the same stark white for one full day. During this time, the Solar subtly alters universal principles with the force of her will, to great effect. The character may use Shinmaic Communion to target a landscape he has created with Wyld-Shaping Technique, redefining its relationship with the great cosmic elements known as the shinma. The character gains ten ‘points’ with which to edit the region in accordance to his will, which may be spent on the following modifications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nirupadhika</strong>, the Way, governs spatial relationships. For one point the Solar may enchant the roads in the region such that they prevent travelers moving along them from getting lost, or infallibly lead them to specific places regardless of where they intend to travel. Two points allow the Solar to speed up or slow down travel according to his design; by default, this halves or doubles travel times, though each point invested beyond the initial two raises this by a factor of one. Three points may designate points within the region as impossible to miss, or occlude them so that all efforts to find them suffer an external penalty equal to half the Solar’s Lore. Four points make the region mobile, able to move (Solar’s Lore) miles per day. Each additional point spent on mobility doubles the region’s movement rate. Five points doubles the interior size of the region without altering the size of its borders—the region is simply bigger on the inside. Each additional point spent on this aspect increases the region’s size by a factor of one.</li>
<li><strong>Dharma</strong>, the Cup, governs corrosion, ignorance and desire. For one point, staying within the region for at least one week counts as a scene spent building an Intimacy of hatred toward a particular social group not native to the region. Two points cause each week spent within the region to count as a scene eroding an Intimacy of the Solar’s choice. Three points create a tenor of desire within the region according to the Solar’s definition; all actions which directly reject this desire are taken at a -2 internal penalty, while all actions in pursuit of it enjoy a +1 circumstantial bonus die. Four points produce a regional agenda—the Solar defines an Intimacy, and each time an individual sleeps within the region, this counts as a scene spent building that Intimacy. Five points hide knowledge about a particular thing from those within the region, inflicting an external penalty equal to (Solar’s Lore ÷ 2) on all attempts to uncover information about the thing; alternately, the Solar may ensure that anyone who seeks a certain thing will find it. This thing must exist within the region, be intangible, of limitless supply, and likely to bring the individual significant turmoil in the future. Valid examples, then, might include worldly insight, occult secrets, or love.</li>
<li><strong>Nirvishesha</strong>, the Ring, governs identity. One point raises or lowers the region’s level of Wyld infection by one stage, for example changing a Middlemarch to a stretch of Bordermarches. Two points summon a certain common variety of little god or minor elemental to flock to the region, according to the Solar’s will (consider the differences between a region full of field gods as compared with one full of bloody hands). Three points may create or close a shadowland within the region, with a diameter no greater than one mile. Four points may create an Essence bias within the region with the same range of flavors as demesnes enjoy (the five elements, Solar, Lunar, vitriol, etcetera). Beings matching this Essence bias raise their base hourly respiration rate by four motes. Five points may alter the cycle of life and death within the region. This may guarantee that all souls go on to Lethe, linger as ghosts, or plunge into Oblivion; or it might create a closed reincarnation loop, where all residents who enter Lethe within the region are guaranteed to reincarnate somewhere within its borders.</li>
<li><strong>Nishkriya</strong>, the Sword, governs conflict. For one point, the region takes on a martial tenor—its people slowly become more generally warlike and inclined to the ways of battle. Each season spent within the region acts as a scene of building a positive intimacy of some kind toward conflict into the Policy of all social groups. For two points, the region becomes a magnet for conflict—it will begin to produce natural resources needed or coveted more by the region’s neighbors than by the region itself. For three points, the region becomes a den of brotherly raiders—all military units raised within the region have a Drill one higher than normal, and all individuals enjoy a +2 situational bonus to all attempts to take something from another person or group by force. Four points formidably defends the region against invasion—its animals attack intruding military forces, and the land itself rises up in protest, causing all movement to be across what is considered difficult terrain, and producing a -1 external penalty to all military activities by invaders. Five points tithed to Nishkriya turns the region into a weapon against hostile forces attempting to move into the Lawgiver’s domain, raining down at least one environmental attack per hour against any invading military unit, of a sort devised by the Solar—avalanches, rains of lightning, supernatural ice storms and localized earthquakes are only the beginning of the woes that may be hurled at unwelcome guests.</li>
<li><strong>Nirvikalpa</strong>, the Staff, is the medium through which communication occurs. One dot makes the region a gathering place for societies, by increasing its yield of timber or making it more fecund farmland. Two dots make the region a magnet for commerce, increasing the amount or value of mineral resources found within. Three dots make the region a point of interaction between its inhabitants and the supernatural world, by seeding the region either with raw materials capable of being refined into the magical materials, or with those materials directly. Four dots makes the region a point of communion between Creation and Heaven, by causing each prayer uttered within the region to count as though it had been spoken from five mouths rather than one. Five dots makes the region a communication network between Creation and itself, drawing dragon lines together to create up to three-dot demesnes throughout the land. This value may be raised by one dot per additional point invested. At least one of each rating will appear, depending on the size.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Solar is not obligated to spend ‘left-over’ points, if he does not wish to do so. A region may only be affected by one use of Shinmaic Communion at a time; additional uses cancel any existing alterations and overwrite them. <em>Shinmaic Communion</em>’s effects vanish upon the Solar’s death, unless a surcharge of all his Willpower is paid upon the Charm’s activation.<br />
This Charm may be purchased up to (Essence) times. Each purchase after the first grants two additional points to spend on shinmaic alterations.</p>

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Shinmaic Communion<br />
Having communed with the foundational elements of the cosmos, the Solars forge miracles. This Charm must be activated in a region the Solar has altered with <em>Shinmaic Communion</em>. The character defines a wondrous aspect or blessing for inclusion within the region. Much like artifact crafting, this Charm is conceptually broad and depends on cooperation between players and Storytellers to design uncanny wonders that later Ages will disbelievingly mythologize and dream of. The parameters of the effect depend on the Shinmaic Communion elements affecting the region this Charm is used in.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nirvikalpa</strong> determines the power of the miracle. One point affecting the region permits the Solar to produce works equivalent to mundane effort. Two points may produce uncanny effects equivalent to thaumaturgy. Three points produce wonders equivalent to Terrestrial Circle sorcery. Four points are equivalent to the Celestial Circle, and five points may produce awe-inspiring effects comparable to Solar Circle sorcery. Zero points limits the effects to only the weakest happenstance, the equivalent of mood lighting—effects with no mechanical repercussions at all.</li>
<li><strong>Nishkriya</strong> determines the strategy of the miracle. Each point of Nishkriya invested in the region allows one trigger to be built into the miracle. Examples of potential triggers include “entering the region,” “praying to the Yozis,” “sleeping within the region,” “stealing from a merchant,” “marching under the flag of a foreign power,” or “disguising one’s identity.”</li>
<li><strong>Dharma</strong> determines who the miracle affects. One point permits only a very limited subset of a population—old men of Varangian descent. Two points allows the miracle to affect a population—Varangians. Three points permits a category of magical beings to be targeted (such as gods, or Dragon-Blooded). Four points affect all individuals who wish to be affected. Five points allows the miracle to target everyone within the region. Zero points limits the miracle to working upon the environment; it cannot affect people at all.</li>
<li><strong>Nirvishesha</strong> determines how long the miracle persists. One point causes the effect to last unto the third generation (60 years). Two points last unto the seventh generation (140 years). Three points last until the 30th generation (600 years). Four points last unto the 50th generation (1,000 years). Five points create a permanent miracle. Zero points invested in Nirvishesha produces a miracle lasting a single paltry year.</li>
<li><strong>Nirupadhika</strong> determines the scope of the miracle. One point affects all regions the Solar has shaped out of the Wyld within a single Direction. Two points affect all such regions he has shaped within the boundaries of Creation, and any realms of the Faraway which he has visited. Three points affect all of the above, as well as the entirety of Creation. Four points affect all of Creation as well as all directly adjoining realms (the Underworld, Malfeas, Yu-Shan, Autochthonia, the Wyld). Five points are conjectured to affect all of existence—even those conceptual frontiers the Exalted have yet to discover or invent. Zero points invested in Nirupadhika affects only the Shinmaic Communion-marked region in which the Charm is used.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, a Solar might lay a blessing of protection on a region lasting for seven generations, so that all invading armies are scoured at its borders by enormous pillars of white-hot sunfire and other horrifying manifestations of Adamant Circle destruction. This would require that the region be affected by two points under Nirvishesha, five under Dharma, five under Nirvikalpa, and two under Nishkriya. Or a Solar might attempt to permanently ennoble all the cosmos so that anyone attempting to initiate into the practice of sorcery will receive this tutelage by the world itself. This would require five points of Nirupadhika, five points of Nirvishesha, four points of Dharma, one of Nishkriya, and two points of Nirvikalpa.<br />
Crafting a miracle is an extended dramatic action using a dice pool of (Intelligence + Lore) with an interval of one day with only enough time to sleep and eat, a difficulty of (points of Nirupadhika used), and a cumulative difficulty of (total number of points used x 10). Abandoning the effort at any point before completion causes the effect to unravel harmlessly. A botch causes the miracle to erupt in some dangerous and unpredictable manner—at best, everyone in the region is likely to have a very interesting day. This Charm’s miracles take effect automatically once crafting is complete.</p>

This Charm permanently enhances <em>Power-Awarding Prana</em> in the following ways: While the Charm’s invocation cost remains unchanged, only five motes must now be committed to maintain its effect. Additionally, it may be applied to any unExalted being (although they are still restricted to learning Solar Charms with an Essence minimum no higher than 1). Those who already possess Enlightened Essence and/or an Essence pool of 10 motes or more do not receive any additional upgrades to those traits.</p>

The excellence of the Lawgivers helps others find greatness of spirit and strength of will. This Charm expands the utility of its prerequisite, enabling the Solar to transfer remaining channels from his Virtues as if they were Willpower points. The Solar can transfer channels for one Willpower point each or use them to replenish spent channels of the same Virtue. The character can mix-and-match, giving Willpower and channels.</p>

Although their own methods of teaching their young the first steps toward civilized intelligence require several years, Solar Exalted who know this Charm can take even the most savage and mindless stalkers and unlock the latent intelligence within them. This Charm permanently enhances the Solar’s ability to train others, permitting him to use <em>Harmonious Academic Methodology</em> to awaken Dragon Kings to rational thought, raising their Essence score to 2 as a Training effect. This Charm may be used only to give stalkers who possess one dot of Essence a second dot. It cannot be used to give Dragon Kings additional degrees of enlightenment. Once the Solar begins the training, the Dragon King becomes calm and curious, not attacking the Solar unless provoked.</p>

The Solar Exalted are unmatched in their technical genius, transcending the limitations of mortal technology with their supernal prowess. Any dice added to the Solar’s computer-based actions by stunts or equipment bonuses are converted into automatic successes. Essence empowers any computer he operates, granting it an unlimited battery life and a perfect wireless connection to the Internet and another networks they can access regardless of location. With a Storyteller-approved stunt, the Solar may even take computer-based actions using other electronic devices, allowing him to hack into systems from his smartphone or access the Internet from his car’s GPS.</p>

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: God-Mind Algorithms<br />
One would sooner crack open a steel vault with his bare hands than infiltrate a Solar’s computer network. As the Solar touches a computer he owns, he commands its least god to be a diligent and faithful guardian of his domain. So long as this Charm remains active, any attempts at hacking that computer suffer a -2 external penalty in addition to any other penalties they might face. The penalty rises to the Solar’s (Essence) against hacking attempts that are not enhanced by magic. In addition, whenever a character fails a roll to hack into that computer, the Solar instantly learns of the attempt, sensing it through the bond of Essence that sustains this Charm. While this intuition does not reveal the identity of the trespasser, it is sufficient basis for the Solar to track them down using <em>Flawless Backtrace Technique</em>.</p>

Speaking his will to the soul of a computer, the Lawgiver reminds it that he is the rightful ruler of the digital realm of information just as he is of the world of men. A Solar may use this Charm whenever he hacks a computer, adding (Essence) automatic successes on his roll to do so. If he has direct physical access to the computer he is hacking, he automatically succeeds on the roll unless that computer is owned by an Essence-user.<br />
The Solar may choose to leave a backdoor in any computer he has hacked using this Charm. Once he has done so, future attempts to hack that computer succeed automatically even if the Solar is doing so remotely or if it is owned by an Essence-user unless the backdoor is removed.</p>

Criminals and miscreants cannot hope to hide from Solar justice behind their computers and proxies. <em>Flawless Backtrace Technique</em> allows the Lawgiver to trace a person through their online identity. He must have some distinctive identifying information of the person he wishes to trace: their email, their account name on an online forum, their IP address, or similar. Running the trace is a dramatic action in which the Solar carries out Essence-enhanced search queries, tracks their electronic activity, and pinpoints the distinctive motonic signature of their online identity. This is an (Intelligence + Lore + Essence) roll at a difficulty of the target’s (Essence + Lore) taking (6 - successes) hours, to a minimum of instant. On a success, the Solar learns that character’s name and their location. Characters who are warded against scrying, or who have their computers warded against scrying, can be tracked with this Charm as it's not a form of scrying.</p>

Most Solar programmers develop signatures in their code, undeniable marks of their presence. With this Charm, an Exalt can turn that sign into a beacon of hope for an ailing computer program, sheathing it in a bulwark of his undeniable name and purpose. This Charm modifies a program that is beset by a computer virus or similar malicious software, arresting the effects of the virus so that it causes no more harm and bringing it to heel, even if the virus is self improving.<br />
In places like the Grand Celestial Mountain, where computer code is personified as spirits, this Charm can cure or terminate all Crippling, Poison, or Sickness effects in one of those characters.</p>

No realm is safe from the commands of the Solar Exalted, not even the most arcane computer architectures. Lawgivers with this Charm can use and program any computer without difficulty, so long as its interface or programming language is written in a language (programming or commenting otherwise) the Exalt can understand. He ignores any external penalties or difficulty increases from lack of familiarity when trying to reprogram a robotic crane, a car-manufacturing line, or to hack into a government database.</p>

Hands flying across his keyboard, modules and references appearing on the screen too fast for the computer to render before the next one comes, a lone Solar Exalted programmer can outstrip a team of the greatest mortal software engineers. This Charm functions like <a href="/solar-craft#toc6">Craftsman Needs No Tools</a>, except that it speeds the creation of computer programs and hacking. Additionally, only the most complete hardware failure or energetic catastrophe can forever claim the programs of the Solar Exalted, the Exalt can repair computer data from the barest scraps.<br />

The simplest of Lore techniques exercised by the Copper Spiders, this Charm allows a Solar to research, develop, and adopt techniques at an unprecedented rate within their domain of study. This Charm is identical to the Dragon-Blooded Charm <a href="/dragon-blooded-lore#toc1">Elemental Concentration Trance</a>, except that it uses the Solar's Favored and Caste Abilities in place of Aspect ones for Abilities and Charms, including for Training effects.<br />
At Essence 3+, the Solar learns (Essence x 3) faster, instead of merely seven times faster.</p>

The Solar Exalted need no tutors or academies. Creation itself is their only school, and their own brilliance the sole teacher they have need of. This Charm allows the Solar to make any roll to recall academic knowledge as a reflexive action, adding automatic successes equal to his Essence. He adds his Intelligence to the roll, rather than his Wits, and the difficulty of the roll is not increased. A young Solar could use this Charm to recall almost any commonly known historical fact or scientific principle, while older Lawgivers might use it to recall the complete texts of epic poems or solve differential equations in their head.</p>

At Essence 6+, the Solar becomes an eternal beacon against the alien threats of Creation, reducing the cost of <em>Chaos-Repelling Pattern</em> to zero motes.</p>

The Princes of the Earth are the rulers of Creation and even the Essence of dragon lines know this. This Charm allows the Solar to force instant attunement with a manse or demesne by standing within its boundaries and imposing her will upon it. If the place of power has no beings attuned to it, this process is automatic. Otherwise, the Solar player must spend 10 motes and roll (Intelligence + Lore) against a difficulty equal to the highest Essence of any being attuned to the place of power. On a failure, the character merely wastes Essence. Success leaves all previous attunements in place, with the Solar joining the group. Regardless of success or failure, all beings attuned to the place know that another has attempted to claim it. First Age manses accounted for this possibility and often hardcoded users into the manse's magitech control systems.</p>
