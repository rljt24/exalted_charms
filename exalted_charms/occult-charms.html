<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: None<br />
The Exalted shape the Essence of the world. This Charm lets the character hone her will to the razor-sharp edge necessary to perform magic of the so-called First Circle, a power infinitely greater than mortal thaumaturgy. This magic can affect up to a few hundred individuals at a time, and its spells take only a few moments to cast. This Charm permits the character to cast Terrestrial Circle sorcery spells.</p>
<h2 id="toc2"><span>Celestial Circle Sorcery</span></h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: -; <strong>Mins</strong>: Occult 4, Essence 4;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: None<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Terrestrial Circle Sorcery<br />
Celestial Circle Sorcery can slay thousands, level fortresses and bind Second Circle demons to the Exalt’s will. Only the Celestial Exalted can master this powerful sorcerous initiation. This Charm permits the character to cast Celestial Circle sorcery spells.</p>
<h2 id="toc3"><span>Solar Circle Sorcery</span></h2>

<strong>Type</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: None<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Celestial Circle Sorcery<br />
The sorcery reserved for the Lawgivers is a work of perfection and adamant. The spells of Solar Circle Sorcery are awesome beyond words, they can bring life to regions or slay entire armies. This Charm permits the character to cast Solar Circle sorcery spells.</p>
<h2 id="toc4"><span>Spirit-Detecting Glance</span></h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 1m; <strong>Mins</strong>: Occult 1, Essence 1;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Reflexive (Step 1)<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Mirror (Spirit-Sensing Glance)<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: One scene<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: None<br />
Spirits cannot hide from the Lawgivers. Spirits such as demons, ghosts and gods often move through the world in dematerialized form, completely hidden from all observers. This Charm lets the character see, hear, smell and feel, but not touch, dematerialized creatures. It makes dematerialized creatures within the normal range of the character’s senses valid targets for the character’s Awareness actions, including reflexive Awareness actions.</p>
<h2 id="toc5"><span>Spirit-Cutting Attack</span></h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 1m; <strong>Mins</strong>: Occult 2, Essence 2;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Reflexive (Step 1)<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Mirror (Corpus-Rending Blow), Obvious<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Instant<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Spirit-Detecting Glance<br />
The Solar Exalted may attack even the subtle Essence of dematerialized spirits. This Charm enhances an attack, making dematerialized creatures within the attack’s normal range valid targets. The attack deals aggravated damage to spirits, materialized or otherwise. Note that if the character cannot see the spirit he attacks, he receives the normal -2 external penalty.</p>
<h2 id="toc6"><span>Ghost-Eating Technique</span></h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 2m; <strong>Mins</strong>: Occult 3, Essence 3;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Reflexive (Step 10)<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Mirror (God-Slaying Torment), Obvious<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Instant<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Spirit-Cutting Attack<br />
The heroes of the First Age used <em>Ghost-Eating Technique</em> to slay the Primordials and the demon hordes. Spirits normally dissipate rather than dying when they lose all of their health levels to damage. The Solar invokes this Charm after making a successful attack that damages or dissipates a spirit. In addition to the normal damage from this attack, this Charm remove a number of motes from the spirit. If the spirit loses its last health level to this attack and dissipates, this Charm consumes the spirit utterly. Its Essence dissolves, and it will never be remade. This equally works against anything unkillable, immortal, or so forth, like that of a behemoth, such as Oliphem or Juggernaut. The only thing this doesn't permanently destroy is the Neverborn, and their servants the Deathlords whose power flows through them, everything else is killed; any such power that prevents them from dying, whether Charm, necromancy, sorcery, or such all fail to prevent their destruction, killing the unkillable.<br />
This Charm cannot drain more motes from a spirit than the total levels of damage dealt by the attack. Motes drained do not go into the Solar’s Essence pool; rather, these torn-off fragments of spiritual power swirl invisibly about her, empowering her to continue her assault upon unruly spirits. For each mote drained by this Charm, the Solar may launch one <em>Spirit-Cutting Attack</em> at no mote cost. Phantasmal images of those spirits damaged or destroyed by <em>Ghost-Eating Technique</em> during the scene flicker and churn within the Solar’s anima until she has used up all captured Essence on <em>Spirit-Cutting Attacks</em>, or until the end of the scene, at which point the drained power dissipates.<br />
This Charm is a natural property of the Exaltation, something that only Autochthon could have devised, and thus can only be used by them and no one else; many beings may possess functionally similar powers.</p>
<h2 id="toc7"><span>Spirit-Repelling Diagram</span></h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 10m; <strong>Mins</strong>: Occult 3, Essence 2;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Simple<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Compulsion, Mirror (Spirit-Desolating Sphere), Obvious<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: One scene<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Spirit-Cutting Attack<br />
The Solar casts out spirits. She spreads her arms, and a blazing ring of gold-white light spreads from her, forming a circle centered on the character with a radius equal to (the character’s Essence) yards. This circle remains centered on the character for the remainder of the scene. This Charm imposes a Compulsion effect on all dematerialized creatures who take actions in this scene. They are compelled not to enter the circle while dematerialized and not to stay within the circle while dematerialized. Resisting costs Willpower equal to the Lawgiver’s Essence, after which the spirit can ignore the <em>Spirit-Repelling Diagram</em> for the remainder of the scene.</p>
<h2 id="toc8"><span>All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight</span></h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 3m; <strong>Mins</strong>: Occult 1, Essence 1;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Reflexive (Step 1)<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Mirror (Through Dead Eyes)<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: One scene<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Spirit-Detecting Glance<br />
Nothing is hidden from the Lawgivers. The character augments his vision with the ability to see patterns of Essence. This Charm allows the character to see motes, Essence-fueled effects, power and invisible but magical creatures and effects. These things become valid targets for the character’s visual Awareness rolls, including reflexive visual Awareness rolls.<br />
The ability to perceive Essence patterns has the following effects: All Charms are treated as Obvious with respect to the character. Dematerialized and invisible creatures and effects are considered visible. The character recognizes all artifacts, manses, demesnes, and dragon lines as such. The character can automatically recognize a creature with Essence 4+ as a supernatural creature. The character can recognize the Essence type of anything they see and their approximate mote pool. Essence type of attuned artifacts, manses, demesnes, dragon lines, and personal Essence type are visually colored by the type of Essence following through them: Water Essence appears midnight blue, Air is sky blue, Fire is red, Wood is forest green, and Earth is chalk white. Lunar Essence gleams argent, Solar is golden, Sidereal produces a shifting chromatic pattern, Nocturnal Essence has a purple night sky hue dotted with stars, Abyssal Essence is pitch black, and Yozi Essence carry strange and abnormal patterns based on the Yozi. Artifacts and Essence users (including the Exalted, the Mountain Folk, the Dragon Kings, mortal thaumaturges who have learned to unlock their Essence, etc.) have a faint anima of their type surrounding and filling them, representing their type and apparent mote value.<br />
If the character makes a <strong>deliberate attempt and action</strong> to analyze what he sees, this Charm allows an (Intelligence + Occult) roll to do so. Identifying the exact effects of an unknown Charm, artifact, spell, Procedure, or magical power is difficulty 5. A known one is merely difficulty 2. Gauging the rating of a person’s Essence trait, exact remaining motes, a demesne, a manse, or an artifact has difficulty 2.<br />
Characters using Stealth to avoid detection are not automatically revealed by their Charms, spells, magical power, Essence trait, type, or mote pool, or carried artifacts, for the same reason that colorful clothing does not automatically void mundane attempts at stealth. Instead, add the <strong>target’s</strong> Essence in dice to any attempt by the character to pierce mundane or magical Stealth. Similarly, this Charm does not automatically void mundane or magical disguises and similar deceptions, and provides the same bonus to see through them, along with always giving the opportunity to see through them. Piercing a disguise doesn't reveal who or what the target is, just merely that they are disguised. Failing to see through a magical disguise results in the Solar seeing what the disguised is designed to show for such things, meaning that a Charm being used for a disguise cannot be identified until it is pierced, along with their Essence rating, type, mote pools, and supernatural status.<br />
This benefit doesn't extend to mundane disguises and thoroughly examining someone might reveal indirectly that they are disguised, such as if their Essence rating or type was wrong for the disguise. If a Solar was using one of his combat Charms while wearing a mundane disguise of a Dragon-Blooded, a user of this Charm could notice his Essence doesn't match that of a Dragon-Blooded.</p>

<strong>Type</strong>: Permanent<br />

<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight<br />
The Lawgivers see all things truly. This Charm upgrades <em>All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight</em>, but it has no cost; the character gains the benefits automatically whenever her anima banner is at or beyond the 4-7 mote level. If she wishes to use Essence sight at some other time, she may commit one mote reflexively to do so. While that mote remains committed, her Caste Mark burns visibly, and she has access to the benefits of <em>All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight</em>.<br />
At Essence 5+, the Solar may choose to show their caste mark or not.</p>

<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 15m; <strong>Mins</strong>: Occult 5, Essence 3;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Reflexive (Step 1 or 2)<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Mirror (Magic-Devouring Strike), Obvious<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Instant<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Spirit-Detecting Glance<br />
Before Brigid discovered sorcery, the Solar Exalted had to counter the world-twisting powers of the Primordials through other means. <em>Magic-Shattering Strike</em> permits the Solar’s attack to disrupt sorcery, necromancy, and Sorcerous-keyword Charms. The Lawgiver targets a spell or appropriate Charm and spends fifteen motes. The Charm or spell must be Obvious to the Lawgiver’s senses to be a valid target for <em>Magic-Shattering Strike</em>. If the attack or defense (which may use any combat Ability) successfully strikes the beneficiary of the spell, or is just used to parry against it, then the spell is broken as though targeted by the weakest level of countermagic capable of affecting it. If the spell is a free-standing effect, such as <em>Rain of Doom</em>, then the attack must be generally aimed at the center of the spell’s area of effect, and the effect is considered to have a Parry DV of (Circle x 3) for spells, or (Minimum Essence + 2) for Sorcerous Charms. Should the Solar successfully shatter a spell or Charm in this fashion, he gains (Spell’s Circle x 4) or (Charm’s Minimum Essence + 2) motes for doing so. <em>Magic-Shattering Strike</em> may explicitly be placed in a Combo with Charms of other Abilities.</p>
<h2 id="toc12"><span>The Time is Now</span></h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: -(+10m, 1wp); <strong>Mins</strong>: Occult 5, Essence 5;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Native, Obvious<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Solar Circle Sorcery<br />
When the Solars graciously accepted the surrender of the vanquished Primordials, they gained authority over their numerous souls and mimetic races, including the power to summon and bind them into service. Sometimes waiting for Calibration—or even sundown—is an affront to the Lawgivers, as if to mock them for the mercies they once accorded. This Charm enhances the spells <em>Demon of the First Circle</em>. At Essence 6+, this power includes <em>Demon of the Second Circle</em>. At Essence 7+, this Charm’s power expands to encompass <em>Demons of the Third Circle</em> as well. When casting one of these spells, the Solar may spend an extra 10 motes and one Willpower to gain the following benefits: The casting time of the spell is reduced to a single hour, and the dramatic action used to shape this spell may begin at any hour of the day and on any day of the year. The concentrated power of the Solar’s will visibly strains the boundaries of existence, causing a localized Calibration more ominous and bizarre than the natural fixing of Creation that marks the beginning and end of each year. For an area of (100 yards for a First Circle demon, 500 for Second Circle demon, and one mile for a Third Circle demon) around her, sunlight bleeds away as surely as the coming of midnight, and sounds somewhere between great hollow wails of torment and the grating of brass echoes out from her location. The Bureau of Destiny is made explicitly aware every time this Charm is used to enhance a summoning, and knows where it was used.<br />
Whenever this Charm is used to summon a demon of the Third Circle outside of Calibration, the Solar must reflexively make a contested roll of his (Intelligence + Occult) against the Dodge MDV of each Third Circle demon he has currently bound. Failing this roll for a single demon permits all currently bound demons to slip free of their bindings.<br />
This Charm also enhances <em>Summon Elemental</em> with the same cost, though without the darkening, the Calibration effect, or informing the Bureau of Destiny. It does not allow the elemental to send a proxy unless it was imprisoned by a being greater than the Solar, like an Incarnae, or the Solar allows them. It also reduces the time to summon to a mere half hour, rushing the elemental across Creation, and explicitly tells the elemental that he is being summoned by the Chosen of the Sun on urgent business. If the Solar allows the being to send a proxy, it instead summons (the Solar’s Essence) number instead, unless the elemental lacks that many to send in which case it sends as many as it can. Otherwise, the spell functions as normal the Solar performs a clash of will against each, but only rolls once for themselves and applies dice reduction to all the elementals being bound.<br />
<em>For example: The Solar cannot summon more than one of the Kukla’s guards, but could summon one in thirty minutes if needed. If he desired to call the Censor of the West, he could force them to appear or (his Essence rating) number of underlings that the Censor has instead.</em></p>
<h2 id="toc13"><span>Eclipsing the Sun</span></h2>

<strong>Type</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Native<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Ghost-Eating Technique<br />
It is the duty of the son to surpass his father. The Exalt may pay three motes and one point of Willpower whenever he activates a Charm with the Holy keyword. Doing so allows the Solar to treat the target of the Charm as if it were a creature of darkness. When using <em>Eclipsing the Sun</em>, the Lawgiver manipulates his instinctual understanding of Holy to supersede—if only for an instant—the will of Ignis Divine. Doing so against another Solar Exalted incurs the additional cost of one point of Limit, as the Exalt’s will strains against the authority of the Most High.</p>
<h2 id="toc14"><span>Power From Darkness</span></h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 3m, 1wp per Charm; <strong>Mins</strong>: Occult 5, Essence 5;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Simple<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Stackable, Shaping, Native<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Indefinite<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight, Solar Circle Sorcery<br />
Veiling her nature in the essence of the eclipse, the Solar reaches through the cracks in the universe the Primordials forged to rip forth power hidden from lesser minds. This Charm allows the character to instantly learn one Charm per three motes committed and one Willpower spent on <em>Power From Darkness</em>. The only limit on this number is the amount of Essence the Lawgiver is willing to commit. These do not have to be Solar Charms, but they must be Charms a character could potentially learn and are not Native keyword Charms. <em>Power From Darkness</em> is subject to the following limitations:<br />
The character must satisfy the trait minimums and prerequisites of all Charms bestowed by <em>Power From Darkness</em> and be able to learn said Charm as per the innate Solar power to learn other Charms. The character must have not only personally witnessed all bestowed Charms in use, but must have analyzed them with <em>All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight</em> and successfully studied them. <em>Power From Darkness</em> may also bestow spells and other non-innate supernatural powers with the same requirements as spells. This Charm does not allow the Solar to learn Sidereal Martial Art Charms through it, as he must initiate into them under the tutelage of a Sidereal and cannot take shortcuts to do this, nor can he learn spells of a circle he does not know.<br />
Whenever the character gains Limit while using <em>Power From Darkness</em> to know a Charm from a creature of darkness while under the effects of the Great Curse, she gains one extra point of Limit per Charm acquired this way on top of whatever amount she would have normally accumulated. The Solar Exalted remain unaware of this flaw in the Charm, though it only occurs while under the effect of the Great Curse.<br />
The Solar counts as a trainer for teaching Charms learned with this, even after this Charm lapses. A Solar may pay experience points at any point to learn the gained Charm permanently and learns spells automatically without needing to commit this Charm.<br />
A second purchase of this Charm, at Essence 6+, reduces its cost to 2m per Charm, 1wp and upgrades the character’s Limit gain from +1 to +2.</p>
<h1 id="toc15"><span>Glories to the Most High: Unconquered Sun</span></h1>
<h2 id="toc16"><span>Black Mirror Revelation</span></h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: —; <strong>Mins</strong>: Occult 5, Essence 3;<br />
<strong>Type</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Keywords</strong>: Native, Avatar (1), Mirror (Unconquered Hero’s Faith)<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Labyrinth Circle Necromancy<br />
This grim Charm was originally developed by ambitious Solars in the final years of the First Age. Frustrated by dead-ending in their study of necromancy at the Labyrinth Circle, they recklessly attempted to forge onward. Those researchers never did break through to the Void Circle. Instead, they found… something else.<br />
This Charm permits a Solar to learn and use Abyssal Charms for which she meets the prerequisites. Additionally, she may accept a point of Limit to activate the Abyssal Mirror of a Solar Charm she knows, with the same limitations as <em>Unconquered Hero’s Faith</em>. As a final side effect, she is guaranteed to linger as a ghost after death, rather than passing on into Lethe. This Charm doesn't allow Solars to learn Void Circle Necromancy as normal, nor an Abyssal to learn Solar Circle Sorcery, such things would likely require greater power than this Charm.<br />
The Charm’s Avatar keyword indicates that the character must possess the Whispers Background at a rating of at least one dot to learn this Charm. <em>Black Mirror Revelation</em> may be learned only through meditation within the depths of the Labyrinth.<br />
This Charm may never be learned by non-Solar Exalted under any circumstances. As a point of clarification, its Abyssal Mirror, <em>Unconquered Hero’s Faith</em>, may never be learned or used by any character who possesses <em>Immortal Malevolence Enslavement</em>.<br />
Furthermore, Deathlords are incapable of learning <em>Unconquered Hero’s Faith</em> or any other Charm based upon fundamental elements of Abyssal Exaltation.<br />
Should the Solar ever break free of the Great Curse, the Solar is no longer guaranteed to linger on as a ghost and doesn't require Whispers to learn it, but still gains Limit as the Great Maker designed Limit to protect the Exalted's mind from such madness. The same is true for an Abyssal that frees themselves of the Neverborn's Resonance and becomes a Solar once more.</p>

<strong>Duration</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Solar Circle Sorcery<br />
This bizarre Charm was innovated in the High First Age by the Solar Queen K’tula. After warping her body into a cephalopod horror through sorcerous manipulation, she found that she could not innovate new Solar Charms that acknowledged the terrible, inhuman capabilities of her new form. Pressing at the outer boundaries of sorcerous understanding, however, she was able to discern a set of cosmological principles more amenable to the thing she had become: the acrid Essence-flows of Kimbery.<br />
Upon learning this Charm, the Solar may now learn the Charms of Yozi and the Green Sun Princes. The character gains a point of Limit the first time she invokes any such Charm within the scope of a scene. The Yozis are aware of this Charm, having used certain of its principles to help guide the formation of their Green Sun Princes. It has historically pleased them to dispatch their Solar akuma to suppress knowledge of the Charm. The Ebon Dragon especially enjoys the bitter regret of his gilded slaves when they realize they bartered away their souls needlessly.<br />
Thanks to the taint of the Great Curse upon their Exaltation, Solars may use this Charm only to unlock the secrets of the mutilated lords of Malfeas. It is possible that a Solar who was somehow cleansed of the Great Curse could also unlock the principles of non-Yozi Primordials and would no longer gain Limit from using any Yozi or Primordial Charm. Thankfully, the Abyssal Exalted and their Deathlord masters have never discovered a Charm building off <em>Void Circle Necromancy</em> to gain access to the magics of the slumbering Neverborn. The most well-informed gods of the Division of Secrets hope such a thing proves impossible.<br />
This Charm may never be learned by non-Solar Exalted under any circumstances.</p>

Just as sorcery lets the Exalted shape Creation’s Essence, necromancy allows them to wield the Essence of the Underworld and death with similar power. Known also as the Iron Circle, <em>Shadowlands Circle Necromancy</em> requires a similar unshakable will and untainted perceptions. This Charm permits the character to cast Shadowland Circle necromancy spells. Because of how much Necromancy is tied to humanity, any living human can learn this Charm. Ghosts are unable to use necromancy even if they knew it in life except for Nephwracks who exist as stubborn exception to that rule. Gods may learn this Charm but don't have the same ease to do so as Sorcery, but Elementals may never learn this Charm as they are too tied to Creation to do so.</p>

Labyrinth Circle Necromancy can instantly create warstriders, devastate battlefields and manipulate the dead without any regard whatsoever for their will.

The Solar touches a spirit and blasts it with white and golden light. Successful contact throws the target back a number of yards equal to (Abyssal’s Essence x 10) and knocks it prone. In addition, the Charm forces the spirit into its natural state, terminating the effects of any Materialize or Dematerialize Charms. Solar with Essence 5+ may “touch” spirits up to 100 yards away using an unblockable (but dodgeable) attack pool of (Charisma + Occult).</p>

<strong>Duration</strong>: Permanent<br />
<strong>Prerequisite Charms</strong>: Ghost-Eating Technique<br />
The Chosen of the Sun are the rightful rulers of Creation and all spirits are theirs to command. This Charm expands the capabilities of <em>Ghost-Eating Technique</em>, giving the Abyssal the option to bind a slain spirit with an unnatural Servitude effect rather than unmake it. At the moment when the spirit would fade away completely, it instead heals back to its lowest -4 health level with no Willpower points remaining and must obey its killer’s orders without the possibility of resistance for a year and a day. Beings enslaved thus must obey normally unacceptable orders, but they need follow only the wording of commands and not their spirit. Storytellers should keep this clause firmly in mind as a legitimate and intended means of reigning in abuses of this Charm.<br />
Actual sorcerous or necromantic binding trumps this Charm and prematurely ends its effects, but &quot;killing&quot; such a bound creature ends the binding and frees them to be bound this Charm. Enslaving a god thus violates Celestial law, and they may bind slain Fair Folk as well as spirits, but they cannot bind spirits or raksha that they did not personally kill.</p>

Masters of the Arcane, nothing escapes the all seeing eye of knowledge of the Exalted, gifting them with the knowledge of the hidden doors of Creation's gifts. Purchase of this Charm makes each hour of work to learn or make a Procedure and Degree count as (Essence x 5) hours and reduces the cost to learn a Degree by half, while Procedures have no experience cost to learn outside of a degree. This cost is change is retroactive.<br />
At Occult 3+, this Charm explicitly allows the Exalt to spend motes to ignore the ritual ingredients of thaumaturgical Procedures on a 2 motes to 1 Resource dot reduction basis. This only applies to consumed ingredients that power the ritual; rare, complex, or specific ingredients cannot be replicated, such as ones that give bonus dice on the roll or gold needed to smelt orichalcum, but certain ones can be with an appropriate stunts; a Solar using their anima for sunlight for example.<br />

Though Thaumaturgy is something of the natural world and Solars nominally transcend it, even the Lawgivers sometimes decide to learn that which is fundamental. This Charm permanently enhances the Exalt's Thaumaturgy by making it so the exchange between Resource dots and motes is a 1 for 1 basis. (For example, a ritual with a disposable Resource cost of 2 and a reusable Resource cost of 4 would cost the Exalt 5 motes to remove those requirements.)<br />
At Essence 6+, the Exalt transcends the mortal world to the extent that he need never worry about the Resource cost of the ritual. His personal Essence naturally and automatically covers all such costs.</p>

The Lawgiver must be free to carry out many duties simultaneously. This Charm permanently enhances the Exalt, reducing to 0 the DV penalties of any Shape Spell or Cast Spell actions she takes.

The Copper Spiders were the undisputed masters of the arcane in the First Age, creating more spell than anyone. This Charm permanently upgrades the Solar's ability to create or learn new spells.
